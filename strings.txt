If I put an X there, then she puts an O on top, and then . . .  But if I put an X on top . . .  Oh snot!
Aaa!  Toadpuke and pigboogers on this game!  I hate it!  It's not fair!  I never win!
Cheater!  You're cheating, Jessie!  Ooo just you wait until I'm big and strong.  Then I'll beat you at every game!
I didn't mean to, ma.  I didn't mean to.
I win again, Billy!  You can't never never never ever beat me!  Billy is a loser!  Billy is a loser!  Wanna play again?
Don't go there, Billy.  I'll win in two moves if you do.  No, not there, either!  Boy, are you stupid!
I'm getting tired.  Oh, Billy!  Are you still playing?  I couldn't hardly tell, it was so easy to beat you.  I thought maybe you'd walked off and let me win.
Watch the death defying spectacle!  Keep your eyes on the high wire.  Never before has any circus presented such an amazing feat of balance!
Hey, who are you ouu ouu!  Ahh!
Oooh, big one!  Come here, I'll swat you.  Come here, little buggie.  Bzzz.  You think you can fly so fast.
You can't sting me.  Too quick for you.  Go back to the hive.  No one else can see you, but I can.
I'll find it.  I can't see you.  Don't think I can't hear you.  I'll follow your buzz right back to the hive.  I'm coming for you.
Men do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his hunger when he is starving.  Yet if he is caught, he must pay sevenfold, though it costs him the wealth of his house.
All those who came before me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep would not listen to them.  I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved.  He will come in and go out, and find pasture.  The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.
Ladies and gentlemen!  Children of all ages!  Come one, come all!  Dare you enter the house of horror?  Recoil in utter terror at the fearsome spectacle that awaits you inside!  Hurry, hurry, hurry!!
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls!  For a mere five tickets, dare to experience for yourself the world's most amazing collection of freaks ever assembled!  See Pret-zool, the human pretzel!  Wonder at the sight of the ferocious dog-boy!  Gasp at the spectacle of the siamese twins!
Step right up and test your skills!  Only one ticket!  Can you master the ring toss?
Calling all sharpshooters!  Prove your skill!  One ticket buys you a chance at the pig shoot!
Show your muscles!  Impress your friends!  Can you knock down all the pins?  One ticket per throw!
W-wicked, wicked ghost!  Get out.  G- g- get out of here.
I won't d- d- do it.  I won't face your v- volcano, or your god.  G- g- g- go away.
Spirits.  Evil sp- sp- spirits.  I'm n- n- not listening!
{E} Gasp!
{E}   Ah-haa!
{N}   Hmm . . .
{N}   What the . . .?
{N} Uh-oh . . .
{E}   Yess!!
{N} Nope.
{E}   Ha ha ha!
{E}   Damn!
{N} Interesting . . .
{E} Ouch!!
{N}   Yuck.
{N}   My God . . .
{N} Yawn.
{N} Sigh.
{N}
{N}
{N}
{N} Feel dizzy . . .
{N} Keep seeing things . . .
{N} What does it mean?
{N} I wish I understood . . .
{N} Can't go that way.
{N} How am I supposed to get there?
{N} The path is blocked.
{N} That's no good.
{N} I don't think that's the right way.
{N} I can't do that.
{N} That would hurt.
{N} No, I don't think so.
{N} Not a good idea.
{N} That's not gonna happen.
{N} I'd really love to . . . but I won't.
{N} What's the point?
{N} I can't use that here.
{N} That won't solve anything.
{N} No, there must be a better way.
{N} This isn't working.
{N} No good.
{E} Come on . . . come on!
{N} That's not right.
{E} Stupid!  Stupid!!
{N} Now what?
{N} No . . . maybe something else.
{N} What was I thinking?
{N} I could just stand here and scratch myself all day.
{N} What do I do now?
{N} Getting drowsy . . . losing . . . momentum . . .
{N} I need to get moving.
{N} Quiet time.
{N} What a creepy place . . .
{N}
{N}
{N}
{N} At least this one looks friendly enough to talk to.
{N} He seems familiar, but I can't quite . . . remember.
{N} What's he doing huddled in the corner?  Trying to hide?
{N} Clearly a disturbed individual.
{E} Aaa!  Somebody shut that damn alarm off!
{N} What a strange and beautiful sculpture.
{N} It's even more extraordinary when it's lit up.
{N} A towel.  Might be useful . . .
{N} A power cable . . . I'd better not touch it with my hands.
{N} Looks like some sort of control panel.
{N} Could be answers in here.
{N} There must be something valuable in there . . . but how do I open it?
{N} Hmm.  What's wrong with this thing?
{N} Wonder if they've got any good movies here.
{N} It's some strange kind of key . . . but a key to what?
{N} An ancient key.
{N} That can't be good for anyone.
{N} Ugh.  These beds are filthy.
{N} The stained-glass windows make me feel like kneeling.
{N} There's a tremendous stink coming through here!
{N} Such a dark, unwholesome place . . .
{N} A bridge.  Now it's extended.
{N} A grotesque sentinel.
{N} That's a nasty drop.
{N} Someone needs to fix that.
{N} What horrible living conditions.
{N} Looks like some sort of control tower.
{N} Huh?  Whoa!!
{E} Oh my God!  Don't . . .
{N} Hup!  Whoooaaa!!
{N} Whoaa!  That short-circut opened the safe.
{N} Ah, now we're getting somewhere.
{E} Finally!  That thing was driving me crazy!
{N} How horrible!  What kind of place is this?
{N} Diagnosis:  crazy!
{N} Creepy kids.
{N} Her hands and face are deformed!
{N} Great.  A bratty kid with two mouths.
{N} My God . . . she's half-worm . . .
{N} This girl has two wooden legs!
{N} His face looks like it's melting.
{N} Poor, misshapen kid . . .
{N} Kid's got an extra arm.
{N} Her . . . her legs are like tree roots!
{N} The boy's face is mottled and . . . leafy?
{N} This kid's just a little more than a baby.
{N} Oh my God . . . this decayed child must be Carol, Dennis' secret weapon . . .
{N} This boy looks almost normal.
{E} What a huge, disgusting nightmare!!
{N} It looks like the statue from the tower.
{N} A rock.
{N} The little kid left his fishing rod . . .
{N} A fishing rod.
{N} A crowbar.  Should come in handy.
{N} Rubber hose.
{N} A rusty wrench.
{N} An empty old gas can.
{N} A key.  My prize for winning Dennis' twisted little game.
{N} Jumper cables.
{N} A shovel.
{N} A metal cross.  Looks like it used to be on top of the church.
{N} The steeple is all blackened . . .  Something's missing . . .
{N} A metallic cross.  I'll need something to fish it out with.
{N} A metallic cross, charred by lightning.
{N} Why are these doors boarded up?
{E} My God!  So many corpses . . .  It's horrible!
{N} Decayed bodies!  Are these the parents?  If I ask the kids directly, it might upset them.
{N} There's no name on this stone . . .
{N} This place must hold some clues!
{N} Hmm. The gate has a combination lock.
{N} The vines are thicker around the barn . . .
{N} This rock must be the source of all the monstrous plant life.  It appears metallic.
{N} The way appears to be blocked by vines.
{N} Looks like I can't go that way.
{N} Somebody needs a driving lesson.  I smell gasoline.
{N} Chalk lines on the sidewalk.  Looks like a game.
{N} Spring flood must have washed out the bridge.  Need some kind of stepping stone . . . Hmm.
{N} Large stones.
{N} A big, ugly duck.
{N} A spring pig.  Cute.
{N} Now I have a spring pig.  Joy.
{N} What is this?  Some kind of sick horse?
{N} Blech, what a mess!
{N} Looks like a barn.
{N} Run-down old house.
{N} Schoolhouse.
{N} The church.
{N} I'd guess it's a general store.
{N} Looks like the town hall.
{N} A big, overgrown pumpkin patch.
{N} Ug.  Moldy lemonade, unfit to drink.
{N} Looks like someone made a fort out of cardboard boxes.
{N} A rusty old swing set.
{N} Well this old junker isn't going anywhere.
{N} What a piece of junk.  Probably only good for spare parts.
{N} An old, gas powered generator.
{N} Headstone.  It says, 'Mike N.  Killed by tainted meat.'
{N} Another headstone.  'Chad F.  Awaiting zombification.'
{N} Guess it's time to check out this 'patch'.
{N} I don't know why, but something about their singing makes me uneasy.
{N} That should get people's attention.
{E} Slice and dice, baby!
{N} Looks like a doctor . . . what's he writing?
{N} Quite a big fellow.
{N} Not a friendly-looking guy at all.
{N} That guy looks like he's going to eat me.
{N} Wonder what's on his mind.
{N} How sad she looks . . .
{N} Seems rather eccentric.
{N} Why'd they chain his hands to his feet?
{N} Is he wearing big bear feet slippers?
{N} Nice tutu, old man.
{N} He looks way too attached to that fish.
{N} Why is that woman licking her lips?
{E} The reflection is moving!
{N} A record.  'The Donner Party Waltz'.
{N} A record.  'Rockabilly Swing Thing'.
{N} A record.  'Belladonna in A flat'.
{N} A record.  'The Ballad of Captain Dick'.
{N} Dried up and depressing.
{N} It looks so much nicer when it's filled.
{N} Are these gargoyles supposed to be conducive to sanity?  The architect was probably an inmate.
{N} An old piece of equipment, but it seems to be working fine.
{N} These are just mannequins!
{N} Whoa.  Those are some big doors.
{N} This is a confusing mess . . .
{E} Ah-ha!  Look what Skippy had under his tutu!
{N} A holy symbol.
{N} An old broom.
{N} Whoever heard of a stained-glass window with clown faces?  Too weird.
{N} What kind of weird trees are these?
{N} Iron gate.  Don't want the bad people to get out.
{N} Another leaky pipe.  Someone should fix that, too.
{N} Ug.  Smells down there.
{N} The water fountain looks nasty.  Doesn't anybody maintain this place?
{N} Very disturbing . . . yet I can't look away.
{N} I hope he only dances with the fish.
{N} Long live the King.
{N} I feel very sane in comparison to her.
{N} Wha . . .?  Guess I'm locked in here now.
{N} Stern-looking fellow.  Where do I know him from?
{N} There was a hole behind the painting.
{N} Huh.  A pipe valve.  Strange thing to hide behind a painting.
{N} Pipe valve.
{N} There's a hexagonal hole at this pipe junction.  Hmm.
{N} What a strange device . . .  I wonder what it controls . . .
{N} Seems to be broken.  The clock's stuck at 7:15 and the alarm at 10.
{N} This gate is shut tight.  What could be so important inside?
{N} This structure is set apart from the rest of the asylum.
{N} There's some kind of electronic security system on this door.
{N} Someone has certainly been busy . . .
{N} A radio.  Wonder if I can get any news from the outside world.
{N} That's the courtyard down there.
{N} Looks like quite a fall.
{N} Whoever built this place loves ominous stone figures.
{N} More gargoyles.  I feel like they're always watching me . . .
{N} Just a child . . . could it have died here?
{N} Please, I've had enough of the circus.
{E} Oh God, it's terrible!
{N} Who would butcher these people like this?
{N} The horror . . . the horror!
{N} There's blood everywhere . . .
{E} Ah-ha!
{N} Oh my God!  It looks like a slaughterhouse!
{N} Well, let's see if that accomplished anything.
{N} She's dead . . . isn't she?  Am I going crazy?
{N} An old man.  He looks cold!
{E} The tree . . . it moves!
{N} This drawer is empty.
{N} No one in this one.
{N} Someone's alive in there!
{N} Empty.  Wait a second . . . there are scratches all over the inside . . .
{N} A woman's corpse.  I'll be in a bag soon, too, if I don't get out of here.
{N} Need to get out of here.  That door's the only way.
{N} Feels a little warm.
{N} Ow!  Too hot to touch!
{N} This pipe is cold.
{N} That's really hot!!
{N} This wall looks pretty badly damaged . . .
{N} Dr. Morgan has an iron bust of himself.  Pretentious.
{N} An Iron bust of Morgan.
{N} Nice oak desk.  Sturdy.
{N} A book of matches.
{N} Matches.  Now I just need some cigarettes.
{N} A gas pipe.
{N} A pipe U-joint.
{N} There are no names on these tags.  This just says '6'.
{N} The tag on this body says '7'.
{N} The tag on this body says '2'.
{N} Ugh.  This body is dripping.  Tag says '3'.
{N} The tag on this one says '9'.
{N} This panel must control the oven.
{N} Lord knows how many bodies have gone into this oven . . .
{N} Ug.  Hope this isn't anyone I know.
{N} A rake.  Looks like it's been used in the crematorium oven.
{N} A glass eye.  Don't think the owner will miss it.
{N} An empty brass urn.
{N} Brass urn filled with ashes.
{N} A bunch of tools in here.
{N} A monkey wrench.
{N} Even the trees appear to be insane.
{N} The sculptor conveniently forgot her shirt.  What's she holding?
{N} Interesting style - at least it's not a gargoyle.
{N} It'd be brighter if all of these trees weren't blocking the sun.
{N} Someone's buried here.  Now the stone is weathered, the name's unreadable.
{N} The ashes show faint scratches . . . a name . . . 'Paul Stark'.
{N} The stone says, 'Eric R.  Get to work you maggots.'
{N} Headstone.  'Stephen B.  Composed as a musician.  Now decomposing.'
{N} Strange place for such a thing.  Is that a crystal heart?
{N} Strange and wonderful prism . . . it seems to focus the light that passes through it . . .
{N} Looks like an Aztec calendar . . . but something's wrong.  There's a device hooked up to it.
{N} There's a nice, warm beam of light coming through.
{N} A book on Aztec culture.  One of the pages is marked . . .
{N} Another book.  Someone's marked a page in here . . .
{N} Looks like a book on the ancient Aztecs.  There's a slip of paper marking one of the pages . . .
{N} Papers scribbled on . . . books on medicine . . .
{N} A globe . . .  Pencil marks on Central America . . .
{N} A phone!  Just my luck.  It's dead.
{N} I can't believe I'm doing this.
{E} Ack!  Ptu!  I swallowed some smoke!
{N} Yes!  The light . . . it's opening the door!
{N} Sarah's doll . . .
{N} A Grimwall comic book.
{N} An Aztec statue.
{N} An empty pedestal.  Something's missing here.
{N} A tombstone.  'Your name here.'
{N} A tombstone.  'Chris P.  See you in hell.'
{N} The stone reads, 'Jeddah Driscoll'.
{N} What does this headless apparition want from me?
{N} A bridge of thorns.  Ouch.
{N} A circle of children.  Are they playing a game?
{N} The pumpkins appear to light up . . . but why?
{N} A tombstone.  It says, 'Jeddah Driscoll'.
{N} A human skull.  Perhaps it belongs to Jeddah.
{N} Children's ashes . . .   How gruesome.
{N} A stone crypt.  It came up out of the ground!
{N} Cement lid.  Looks heavy.
{N} Jeddah's body, without a head.  No wonder he was restless.
{N} Thorny vines.
{N} A barricade of pumpkins.  How odd.
{N} This game appears to be a test of strength.  Hit the board and ring the bell.
{N} A giant clown head.  What an eyesore.
{N} The mouth seems to be a passageway . . . but it's on fire!
{N} Why are these teeth flashing colors?
{N} Clown nose.
{N} The clown nose broke to reveal a small hole . . .
{N} I can see something in the fog . . . a flaming car.
{N} Hmm.  Strong gates.
{N} A bridge of webs . . . it looks very delicate.
{N} A stone head.  It seems to transmit energy to the statue.
{N} Statue of Quetzalcoatl . . . it's saturated with power!
{N} These plates on the floor look like they could move.
{N} Impaled Aztec warriors.  They're . . . screaming.
{N} Spirits of the impaled warriors.  Who can blame them for wailing?
{N} Energy coursing through the floor.  Looks dangerous.
{N} A crystal monolith . . . there's something inside!
{N} Interesting.  Some kind of liquid flow regulator controls the lock mechanism for this door.
{N} Ug.  Big maggots.
{N} A mass of honeycomb cells.
{N} An insect mandible.
{N} Clamp mechanism.  Four separate levers appear to hold this machine in place.
{N} This machine generates a strange noise.  It seems to be some kind of disruptor.
{N} A sonic disruptor.
{N} A grate in the floor.  There's a tunnel underneath . . .
{N} Thorny vine.
{N} I have to cut that cord in order to get the piece of statue down.
{N} The head of the angelic statue.
{N} The angelic statue's left wing.
{N} Right wing of the angelic statue.
{N} The torso of the angelic statue.
{E} A portal to another place!  Hope that the real world is on the other side.
{E} A checkerboard pattern . . . is this just a sick game?!
{N} My own worst enemy . . .
{N} A glass statue of Sarah . . . holding an orb of some kind . . .
{N} Glass statue of Grimwall.  He's got something in his hands.
{N} A glass statue of Olmec.  He's holding an orb.
{N} A black, viscous monstrosity . . . I think it's supposed to be Morgan!
{E} I can see through to another world . . . I'm in a hospital bed . . . there's a woman . . . Jennifer!
{N} Hmm.  Long way down.
{N} There . . . the angel is completely reassembled.
{N} That VCR won't work anymore.  It's fried.
{N} A switch . . . must control the alarm.
{N} There's something you don't see every day.
{E} Stop it!  Stop it!  You're driving me mad!!
{N} Somebody down there . . .
{N} Try this, it might hurt less.
{N} Burn, baby, burn.
{N} It's burning all right.  I feel swell.
{N} Stained glass window.  Looks like some children.
{N} A scarecrow on a stained glass window?  Weird.
{N} Who would put pumpkins on a stained glass window?
{N} A stained glass window . . . What the hell is that?
{N} That must be the generator.  Looks bad . . . how do I get out of here?
{N} There's a walkway . . . but it's retracted.
{N} Can't believe I'm doing this . . . whooaaa!  Uh!
{N} There's a locking mechanism in the base . . . but what for?
{N} One . . . two . . . three . . . four . . . five . . . six . . . seven . . . eight . . . nine . . . ten!
{E} Ah-ha!
{E} There you are!
{N} A full gas can.
{N} He's praying . . . I'd better leave him alone.
{N} Excuse me . . .  Hello?  Guess he's too busy to talk right now.
{N} These kids seem happy, anyway . . .
{N} Their voices . . . so haunting . . .
{E} Shut up!  Shut up!  I can't take it anymore!!
{N} Crows . . . carrion birds . . .
{N} Looks like a control box . .. it's locked.
{N} Hmm.  This door is locked.
{N} This hose should come off ...  can't get it with my bare hands.
{N} Okay ...  there we go.
{N} There's . . . a sense of menace in this area . . . I'd better find a weapon . . .
{N} Shouldn't get too close to the edge . . .
{N} Hmm.  The cables need to be plugged in before I can use the VCR.
{N} The hands on the clock . . . they're . . . they're moving backwards!
{N} An old church organ.
{N} These vines are everywhere!
{N} This whole town has a serious weed problem.
{N} Ugh!  Barrels filled with rotten fish!
{E} Damn!  Useless crap!  And I was so sure that I would find some clues in here!
{N} I doubt the circus will be coming to this town anytime soon.
{N} A decaying corpse.  What a God-awful stench!
{N} Jesus, it stinks!  Who died in here?!  Oh . . .
{N} A simple kid's game.  Shouldn't be too hard.
{N} I'll need the right combination to open this.  Now let's see . . .
{N} Anatomical diagrams . . . must be part of Morgan's work.
{N} These pipes . . . they must control the water flow to the fountain.
{E} How could anyone describe such atrocities so . . . so clinically!
{N} Youth hides the key to salvation.
{N} It seems that the rotating electromagnet is linked to the stone weight.  But what is the machine's purpose?
{N} Must . . . open the door . . . get out of here . . .
{N} How do I start this gruesome thing?
{N} The scratches don't look arbitrary.  Was someone trying to communicate something?
{N} This isn't a normal Aztec calendar.  Some of the parts move.
{N} It's dark in here.  I can't quite make out what these scratches are.
{N} Doors have frozen shut.
{N} The locking mechanism is . . . organic!  It's controlled by the fluids that sustain it.
{N} The drawers are held shut by an electronic lock.
{N} Not from here.
{N} Too far away.
{N} Brr.  It's so cold in here . . .
{N} The VCR is fried.
{N} It feels much warmer in here.
{N} It's too heavy.
{N} It's the angelic statue's head!
{N} A statue of Quetzalcoatl.
{N} There's some kind of energy field surrounding the sonic disruptor.
{N} Strange machinery.  There are four control levers.
{N}   I'm just not strong enough.
{N} Those things will shred my feet if I try to walk on them.
{N} I'm not putting my hand in the fire!
{N} This place . . . there's an overwhelming sense of menace.  I'd better arm myself before I go in.
{N} The generator's working now.
{N} A full gas can.
{N} There's something under this monster's tentacle.
{N} A wooden plank.
{N} Ugh.  Enormous maggots.
{N} What is that?  It looks like a giant . . . eye?
{N} Better, but it's still not complete.
{N} Uhh!  These drawers are frozen shut.
{N} From the fumes, I'd guess that the tank is full.
{N} Looks like a flood washed out the bridge last spring.
{N} Doesn't seem to be working.  Must need power first.
{N} Youth.
{N} Hides.
{N} The.
{N} Key.
{N} To.
{N} Salvation.
{N} Keep moving back and forth between worlds . . . What does it mean?  Where am I now?  Looks like a . . . morgue.
{N} Statue of an Aztec warrior . . . looks almost lifelike.
{N} No turning back now . . . but what lies ahead?
{N} A headstone.  It says, 'Jonas Bruener.  He deserved to die.'
{N} This headstone says, 'Travis W.  Nice goddamn cat!
{N} A headstone.  This one says, 'Chris S.  One beer too many.
{N} A headstone.  'Greg C. He made his bed, and now he sleeps in it.'
{N} The base of the angelic statue.
{N} I can't believe it!  I'm not that kind of person.
{N} No, I'll need a hose to siphon out the gas.
{N} A bell.  I'll bet it hasn't called anyone to church in a long time.
{N} The steeple looks charred.  Maybe it was hit by lightning.
{N} Must be out of gas.
{N} It says, 'Danger, High Voltage.'
{N} Looks like a jumper cable.  Might be useful.
{N} Looks like a tool, but I'm not going to reach for it with that slimy tentacle all over it.
{N} I've got to kill that diseased monster before it kills the children!
{N} A wrench, courtesy of . . . well, thanks, Mom.
{N} There, the children are free of you!
{N} C. Driscoll, missed dearly by Mother.
{N} Today's sermon:  Psalm 4, verse 51.  The gates of Heaven.
{N} Damn!  He keeps coming.  There must be another way.
{N} Got him!  Guess he thought it was better to burn up than fade away.
{N} There you are.  My God, what kind of hiding place is this?
{N} Some sort of control box for these water lines.  I'll need something to pry it open.
{N} I have a feeling there's a message hidden in this rambling mess.
{N} That ought to defrost this whole building.
{N} I need something to bust through this wall.
{N} Their wailing could shatter my ear drums.
{N} Ahh, can't hit it from here!
{N} What's happening to me?
{N} Well, that was an eye opening experience.
{N} Difficult to read.  Isn't there an old trick about rubbing soot on worn carvings to make them legible?
{N} The secret to activating the device appears to be the use of five distinct symbols.
{N} A human skull.
{N} Oh . . . what . . . what . . . what's happening?  Wh . . . Where am I?
{N} It's not working.  Looks like I have to move all four switches simultaneously in order to release the machine.
{N} There's a lock on the gate.  Something feels wrong about this place . . . I'd better talk to someone, find out what I'm getting into.
{N} Sniff, sniff.  I smell gas.  Must be an open valve nearby.
{N} The . . . asylum?  How did I get back here?  Those children seemed so real . . . did I save them, or am I going completely mad?
{N} Fun.  I should ride the rest.
{N} Goodbye, Sarah . . . it's time for me to face the future.  Rest well.
{N} The clock is running counter-clockwise!  The time is 1 o'clock, and the alarm is set to 8.
{N} Now where am I?  Cyclops . . . bugs . . . Mother.  All of these monsters must mean something . . . but what?!
{N} Quetzalcoatl murdering an entire village . . . Morgan trying to kill me . . . Now I see the connections!  None of this is real!
{N} No way to get the disruptor out while it's protected by that force field.
{N} Who am I now?  Have to hold on to my identity . . . I am Max.
{N} My God!  They . . . they must have been illusions!  Everything is!
{N} The clown's  nose has popped out.  Now there's a small hole.
{N} The disruptor is working!  The grubs have moved away from the grate.
{N} A honeycomb.  Looks like something is inside.
{N} Those webs will never hold my weight.
{E} The statue is reassembled, and a portal has opened!  The real world must be close . . . I can feel it!  I'd better move quickly!
{N} A piece of the angelic statue was trapped in the crystal.
{N} Well, I guess it's true.  You can't go home again.
{N} Steam escaping from a hole in the pipe.
{N} Huh.  That didn't quite do it.
{E} Got it!
{N} Spirits hovering above the dead warriors.
{N} Morgan!  I'll get past this demon of yours somehow!  You can't  hold me here!
{N} I'm running out of time!  Got to hurry!
{N} No more games, Morgan!
{N} A birdhouse.
{N} A wall of impaled pumpkins.
{N} Boards lying across the gap.  They seem to form a bridge.
{N} A stained glass window.
{N} A wooden walkway, just like at the circus.
{N} A bridge made of organic material.
{N} A strange hut.  Looks like the structures that made up the Hive.
{N} Fountains of blood.
{N} Ungh.  I'm not strong enough to move this thing.
{N} I could move this thing, but that other statue is in the way.
{E} Have to get through those columns, the real world lies beyond!  This . . . thing won't let me pass!  What am I supposed to do?!
{N} Black sludge on the floor, the same stuff that shadow creature is made out of.  I'd better not step in it.
{E} The shadow is gone . . . You've failed, Morgan!  I'm gonna live!!
{N} Sonic disruptor . . . I've seen that before.
{E} Damn you, Morgan!  I swear you'll pay!!
{E} Morgan!  Only he stands in my way!
{N} That must be the generator.  They said it could explode any minute!  How do I get out of here?
{N} Another bed.  Ugh.  Smells like it's soaked with urine.
{N} Bite me.
{E} Gasp!
{N}   Hmm . . .
{N} Uh-oh . . .
{E}   Wheeee!!
{N}   Hee hee hee!
{N}   Oh poo!
{E} Ow!!
{N}   Yuck.
{N} Yawn.
{N} Sigh.
{N}
{N}
{N}
{N} I don't feel so good . . .
{N} I keep seeing pictures in my brain.
{N} My head really hurts.
{N} I can't go that way!
{E} No way!
{N} I don't think I can go there.
{N} I don't think I can do that.
{N} That would hurt!
{N} Maybe I'll try it later.
{N} Should I?  Oh, I couldn't . . .
{N} That would be very, very bad.
{N} I can't do that.
{N} That didn't work.
{N} I need to try something else.
{E} There's gotta be a way!
{N} What else should I do?
{N} I could use a nap.
{N} Where's the bathroom?
{N} I'm bored . . .
{N} I don't like it here.  It's spooky . . .
{N}
{N}
{N} He's got a big red nose like Santa!
{N} Neat!  His arm is a fishing pole!
{N} This man has pictures all over his body.
{E} Oh my, what big arms he has!
{E} Such a beautiful costume!
{E} He can juggle with only one arm!
{E} Ug!  Poo!  He stinks!
{N} I hope she doesn't throw one of those at me.
{N} Poor, sad little clown!
{E} He's so big and round!
{N} That clown scares me.
{N} His breath smells funny.
{N} I guess he runs the Fun House.
{N} He looks like a Mr. Potato Head put together wrong.
{E} Ooo!  She has a crystal ball!
{E} Wow!  They have games!
{E} He's all bendy!
{N} I can't tell if he's a man or a big dog!
{E} Eww!  They're connected!
{N} Hey!  Another kid!
{N} She must be cold.
{N} Aw, he looks so sad.
{N} It's a ghost boy!  I feel like I know him . . .
{N} This is too creepy . . .
{N} He's a big ghost.
{N} She's pretty - for a ghost.
{E} A free pass for the squid squash!
{N} It's a game ticket.
{N} Those look like game tickets.
{N} I've got a game ticket.
{N} Look, I have some game tickets.
{N} An oil can.
{N} A bowling pin.
{N} It's a red rubber juggling ball!
{N} A broken piece of mirror.  I hope I don't get bad luck!
{N} Inferno says I can use the baton to breathe fire.
{E} I can see everything through these!
{N} Funny . . . where's the nose?
{N} It looks much better now that it's got a nose.
{N} This must be for the Merry-go-round.  But it's all rusted up.
{N} Hmm.  It's rusted shut.
{N} Wow!  That's deep!
{N} Yuck!  This needle doesn't look very clean.
{N} It says 'rubbing alcohol'.  Eww!  Smells like clown breath.
{N} Are those . . .  h-human bones?
{N} Just a bunch of dry twigs.
{N} That's the hole that Timber dug.
{N} I think these switches will turn on the lights.
{N} What a wonderful old clock.
{N} Hey, I can watch a movie!
{E} Wow!  Doesn't that look fun!
{N} Hmph.  I can't get past that ol' pile of junk!
{N} I bet there are all kinds of games and toys in there.
{E} A big, snuggly stuffed bear.  Oh boy!
{E} Hey!  That's where the key is hidden!
{E} This game is neat!
{E} What a neat dolly!  I'll call him Mr. Clown!
{N} A brass key.  Wonder what it's for?
{N} A silver key.  It's all shiny.
{N} Ooo!  This key is gold!
{N} Here's a video tape.  It says 'home movies'.
{N} Whoa, those don't look too safe.
{E} Wow!  The tent must be a million feet wide!
{N} Boy, I wouldn't want to go up there!
{N} These houses look so sad, like they're going to fall down any minute.
{N} Fire barrel.
{N} Mmm.  Vodka.
{N} What a cute little wagon.
{N} Neat little tent!
{N} Spooky!
{N} It looks fun . . . but the animals scare me.
{N} It says, 'Freak Beach'.  That's a funny name for a beach.
{N} The wagons don't look like very comfortable homes.
{N} The water . . . it's so dirty!  I can't see the bottom!
{N} The water's so dark . . .
{N}  That squid monster is in here somewhere.
{N} I've never heard of this game before.
{N} Do I hafta shoot real pigs?
{E} This game looks easy!
{N} This doll only has one eye, but 4 arms!
{N} Birdhouse.
{N} What a mess!
{E} Woo!  That looks hot!
{N} What a pretty lady!
{N} Somebody's granpa.
{N} This must be the ugly cousin.
{N} I guess this is the family that lived here.
{E} I can see the other island!
{N} Looks like more rain . . .
{N} Whatever it is, it's dead.  Icky.
{N} A radio.  I wonder if I can get any music . . .
{N}
{E} Ooooo!  Wow!
{N} Umm . . . I feel all sick . . .
{N}  Huh!  They're burning!
{N}
{N}
{N}
{N} That'll teach you to play nice.
{N} See you in hell, freak.
{N} Oh wow!  Look at all of the pictures!
{N} I want this one on my arm, a skull and crossbones.
{N} I wonder what all of these star pictures mean.
{N} Creepy . . . it's making me nauseous.
{N} The walls are squirming . . . like they're not even real!
{N} Yuck!  The food in here is all rotten.
{N} Something's burnt up in the bottom -- I don't even want to know what it is.
{N} Nothing but dirty dishes.
{N} Huh!  I have no reflection!!
{N} Weird.  The paintings move.
{N} Looks like Edward Munch's work.
{N} It's rocking all by itself.
{N} An old fireplace.
{N} Oh my God!  The walls are bleeding!!
{N} The trains are moving, but they aren't plugged in.
{N} It looks like a toy chest.
{N} An old dollhouse.
{N} It's locked.
{N} Someone broke out of this cage . . . or something . . .
{N} The clock is open.  Now I can move the hands.
{N} No way!  The water's so dark!
{N} Light.
{E} What?!
{E}   Ah-haa!
{N}   Hmm . . .
{N}   What the . . .?
{N} Uh-oh . . .
{E}   Yess!!
{N} No.
{N}   Ha ha ha!
{E}   Grap!
{E}   Blech!
{N} Yawn.
{N} Sigh.
{N}
{N}
{N} Dizzy . . . can't . . . concentrate . . .
{E} Aaa!  There's a fire in my brain!
{N} What in the name of the Maker . . . ?
{N} I don't understand . . .
{N} Hmm.  Can't go that way.
{N} If only I could get there . . .
{N} The path is blocked.
{N} That's impossible.
{N} No.  Perhaps there is another way, though.
{N} I can't do that.
{N} That would harm even me.
{N} It would be enjoyable . . .
{N} No, not now.
{N} I can't use that here.
{N} That won't solve anything.
{N} This isn't working.
{N} No luck.
{E} Come on . . . come on!
{N} That's not right.
{N} Now what?
{E} There has to be an answer!
{N} Hey!  I've got four thumbs to twiddle.
{N} What now?
{N} The great hero at rest.
{E} I need to do something!
{E} Come on!  There's work to do!
{N} The longer I stay here, the worse things get.
{N}
{N}
{N}
{N}
{N} He's planning something diabolical . . .  I know it!
{N} A handsome young Cyclops.  I hope he can help me.
{N} This cyclops is half bug!
{E} What have they done to this poor fellow?!  He's got an Insectoid body!
{E} She's half-bug, but she still seems aware as a Cyclops!
{N} This monster is also half-machine.
{E} Ugh!  I can hardly stand to look at these beasts!
{N} I'd better be careful on these paths.  It's a long way down . . .
{N} I can barely see the ground through all the clouds.
{N} Gravin's tools.
{N} The creature is weaving silk into thick ropes.
{N} Some kind of scanning unit.
{N} It seems to be a bottled fuel.
{N} Looks like an operating table.
{N} A golden bug limb.
{N} An Insectoid pincer.  The edges are sharp.
{N} This machine appears to drain the creatures' silk.
{N} A container filled with silk.
{N} A rope woven from silk.
{N} A defense mechanism for Gravin's pod.
{N} The heater . . . it's alive!
{N} Wonder if Gravin has any good crystals.
{N} These designs . . . I do not understand them.
{N}   'When the two species are merged, a kind of super-metabolism is possible.'
{N}   'Bugs will kneel before immortal Gromna!'
{N} Gromna is clearly insane.
{N} Mutilated grubs . . . what is Gromna doing with them?
{N} Pillow.  Fluffy.
{N} A locked cabinet.  I suspect that the traitor keeps something important within.
{N} A key.
{N} Hmm.  A control device.  It seems to be generating an odd sound.
{N} The insects are pumping a bellows to control the furnace.
{N} Hmm.  This pipe has been fixed recently - though not too well.
{N} The Insectoids' abominable furnace.
{N} They are refining fuel for their mechanized parts.
{N} Bugs flying up that tube . . .  Where does it lead?
{N} The furnace operator's mechanical limb.
{E} By the Maker!  These are Cyclops babies!!
{E} Cyclops babies . . . in bottles?!
{E} A cyclops baby in a bottle.  Atrocity!
{N} Must I pass through the bowels of the monster?
{N} I'll burn all of these grubs before I leave here.
{E} If allowed to mature, these vile Insectoid grubs would overrun the world!
{N} A slimy disgusting Insectoid grub.
{E} Caged Cyclops children?!
{E} Children in cages!  Everything I see in this place enrages me more!!
{N} The grubs make noise.  For what purpose?
{N} Even the doorway is blocked by a living wall of worms.
{E} Ah, grown Cyclops children!  What a horrible fate!
{E} Their blood is being drained by this infernal machinery!
{E} How can I save these children from such an atrocity?!
{N} This looks like part of the Great Machine . . . but I can't move it.
{N} A piece of machinery.  I hope this is what Gravin wanted.
{N} I'll have to climb up there somehow.
{E} The Insectoid Queen!  I will not rest until she is destroyed!!
{N} Make your speeches now, traitor.  You won't have breath for long.
{E} Monsters!  I'll crush you . . .  No!  I must complete my task for Gravin!
{N} The machine on the Queen's back . . . it looks like the part Gravin wanted!
{N} A great machine of some sort.  It's size alone speaks of untold power.
{E} This is truly the mother of all evil!
{E} How can she even move her sickeningly bloated bulk?!
{E} Is this all the body of a single beast?!
{E} Bah!  A heap of disgusting insect eggs!
{N} This building appears to serve some special function.
{N} The glow from within . . . must be some large fire.
{N} A large hut.  Looks like someone's living quarters.
{N} A small hut.
{N} What goes on in this structure?
{N} The bridge seems flimsy.
{N} The only good bug is a dead one.
{E} Grap!
{N} The mechanized arm survived the fire . . . hmm, I wonder if it can be used against the beasts.
{N} No more genocide today, monsters.
{N} Thanks for the grub.
{N} Unnh!  Too big to carry down the rope.  Even with four hands, that would be difficult.  I must find another way.
{N} These grubs are making some kind of faint noise.  I wonder . . .
{N} A sledge hammer.  Should come in handy.
{N} Hmm.  This insect is hooked up to a machine, and the levers must control the furnace.
{N} The bellows.  They are used to fan the flames of the infernal machine.
{N} The machine has an empty chamber.  What must be placed inside?  And what for?
{E} Eh?  Rrraaagghhh!!!
{N} Hmph.  This thing has some kind of mechanical harness.
{N} Wearing this harness, perhaps they'll think I'm one of them.  It's worth a try.
{E} It's some kind of alien child . . . with two eyes and two arms!
{N} The insect is performing a grotesque experiment . . . putting bits of machinery into the child.
{N} Gromna's notes . . . they say that the sound generator will open the worm transport tube.
{E} They're . . . they're dropping cyclopean babies into the furnace!
{N} No, my strength will break the bottle.  I need something to cut it free.
{N} Strange.  They seem to mark an entrance . . . to nowhere.
{N} These poles are the same as those near the Great Machine.  How are they connected?
{N} Controls of some sort, their purpose unknown.  I'd best leave them alone for now.
{N} These controls are similar to those Gravin used to create the portal.
{N} I've seen controls similar to those in the Queen's chambers.
{N} This pillow appears to be rather lumpy.
{N} A sound generator.
{N} With that bug gone, I can reach the controls.  I'll shut down this abominable furnace.
{N} Hmm.  This is more complex than I imagined.  There appear to be many controls, all interrelated.
{N} No more embers will be delivered now.  I'm certain I'll find Gravin resting in his pod.
{N} A cyclops baby in a bottle.  It's held fast by a thick cord.
{N} A tube or tunnel of some sort.  I wonder how can it be activated.
{N} I need something to stop this machine.  Only then can I disengage and remove it.
{N} This would appear to be the worm transport tube mentioned in Gromna's schematics.
{N} An image of the Cyclops planet.  I must not let these bugs destroy my people.
{N} Cameras, broadcasting Gromna's vile words to the enemy masses.
{N} These screens show the enemy horde, cheering Gromna's speech.  There are so many of them!  Surely the Cyclops race will be destroyed unless I can stop the Insectoids!
{N}   Huh.
{N}   Hmm . . .
{N}   By the gods . . .?
{N}   Ha ha ha!
{E}   Bah!
{N}
{N} How strange . . .
{N} I am plagued by visions.
{N} What do these illusions mean?
{N} I cannot go that way.
{N} It is not possible.
{N} The path is blocked.
{N} Surely there is another way.
{N} No.
{N} That would be foolish.
{E} Such an action is unworthy of the Holy Warrior!
{N} Perhaps another time . . .
{N} I can't use that here.
{N} Surely an unwise course of action.
{N} This is not doing anything.
{N} What more can I do?
{N} No, that's useless.
{E} Enough games!  Yield before Olmec!
{E} These inanimate objects mock me with their silence!
{N} It defies comprehension . . .
{N} Now what?
{N} No . . . maybe something else.
{N} Hmm.  What next?
{N} I will soon become a true statue.
{E} Impatience burns within my stony breast!
{N} The Sacred Warrior surveys the wrecked village.
{N}
{N}
{N} Here is the woman whose magic summoned me.
{N} There is the evil god himself.
{E} Is this old one preparing for battle?!
{N} This lowly worker appears strong and proud.
{N} Why does this woman worry so?
{N} Ah!  A precious little one!
{N} Can one woman's sorrow be so great?
{N} A truly venerable woman.
{E} An unhappy spirit!
{N} His soul still dwells here.
{N} What does this noble warrior seek?
{N} He too has been slain by the evil god.
{N} This spirit is restless for justice.
{N} This one appears to have died very young.
{N} These people have called me.  I heard their voices.
{N} The Wall of Sorrow.  Images which tell the story of this village.
{N} They have honored Quetzalcoatl with this statue - and he repays them with destruction.
{N} Big totem pole.
{E} Boulders are no match for the mighty Olmec!
{N} These gongs produce music.
{N} A large crystal . . . I can see something inside.
{N} Many have been sacrificed on this spot.  Some for good, some for evil.
{N} This wall . . . doesn't seem right.
{N} The witch doctor's broken body.  Rest now, valiant one.
{N} Witch doctor's corpse.  His blood flows freely from wounds that will not heal.
{N} This must be the Pod of Might.
{N} An empty copper bowl.  It must have been used for sacrifices.
{N} A sacrificial bowl filled with the blood of the witch doctor.
{N} A large statue.  Violent earth magic has made it unstable.
{N} A sacrificial bowl.  It is caked with dried blood.
{N} An empty sacrificial bowl.
{E} The jaguar head . . . it speaks!
{N} The stone jaguar head is silent now.
{N} Big head.
{N} Ah!  It is some kind of mirror, but what is its purpose?
{E} A beam of light!  Some great magic is at work here!
{N} Interesting.  The sculpted fish are hollowed out.
{N} A slab of broken rock.
{N} A flat stone.  It is painted and shaped . . . part of some sculpture?
{N} Carved stone.  It seems to be a piece of something greater.
{N} These plates are triggers for some complex mechanism.
{N} A grating in the floor, and water below.  I can see something glimmering in the depths.
{N} The Wind Totem.
{N} The Water Totem.
{N} The Jaguar Totem.
{E} A ruby fish!  It's blood-like coloring must indicate something important!
{N} Quetzalcoatl's Death Mask.
{N} Strange wheels.  What is their function?
{N} This must be the Jaguar temple.
{N} Clearly, this is the temple of Water.
{N} The temple of Wind.
{N} Quetzalcoatl's dark magic stirs the earth's blood.
{N} Scalding lake of lava.
{N} This water is impure.
{N} A waterfall, demonstrating the raw power of nature's gods.
{N} Such destruction.  Much of the original village seems to be buried beneath the rocks.
{N} Innocents crushed in the fist of the evil god.
{N} The unholy one's power must be great indeed.
{N} Pah!  Quetzalcoatl has desecrated the bodies of such honorable warriors!
{N} There!  The way is open to me.
{E} The Jaguar's power is revealed!
{N} Ah!  Must take care in this old place . . .
{N} That was close!
{N} These pathways are not strong.
{E} Quetzalcoatl, I come for you!
{E} Now, Quetzalcoatl, it's time for you to return to the land of the dead!!
{N} Images carved in stone . . . somehow these hold the key to the water temple.
{N} A tree growing in the lava.
{N} These huts escaped the evil one's wrath.
{N} The village is in ruins.
{N} Such destruction . . . surely these people did not deserve this fate.
{N} Simple pottery.
{N} A clay pot of crude design.
{N} The candles give off a powerful fragrance.
{N} She has poisoned herself . . . and joined her husband in death.
{N} Murals of ancient heroes.
{E} What?!  No painting of the mighty Olmec?!
{N} These are the sacred fires.
{N} A crystal heart.
{N} This lever locks the gate in place.
{N} The platform where the statue once stood.  Wait . . . three round indentations are now visible.
{N} Ugh.  The stench of death rises from below.  Could this be the dead king's tomb?
{N} This looks like a release switch.
{N} He is too powerful.  I must find a way to destroy the evil one!  Perhaps I may find some magical talismans nearby . . .
{N} Another hut.  The air around it smells of magic.
{N} Huts of the ruined village.
{N} These huts are the empty and crushed hopes of the villagers.
{N} Sacred blood flowing from the noble Witch Doctor's corpse.
{N} The lava has cooled in the water, and now forms a solid span of rock.
{N} Fallen statue.  No great feat for one so mighty as Olmec.
{N} A river of the Earth's blood, flowing freely now that the statue is removed.
{N} Hmm.  Stone wheels, set to turn for some strange purpose.
{N} A statue.
{N} These flies are all over the village.  They feast on the misery of others.
{N} Stone steps.  The symbols carved into them mark this as a place of great magic.
{E} The death mask of Quetzalcoatl!
{N} There are some files here.
{N} A diary.  No name on it, but it looks like a little kid's writing.
{N} A newspaper article.
Most sacred warrior!  You must find blood that springs from a holy heart, and a heart which does not bleed.  Place these two offerings in the bowls before you, and then you may enter the Temple of the Jaguar.
Holy warrior!  An honorable offering is made, but still more is required before the temple door will open.  Seek the blood that flows from a sacred heart, and place it in the second bowl.
Holy one!  This blood is sacred indeed, but still a second offering is required:  the heart which does not bleed.  Find this and the door of the temple shall open.
This is a noble offering, holy warrior.  But it is misplaced.
The offerings are accepted, the Jaguar Temple door opens before sacred Olmec!
Max, come upstairs.    There's nothing you could do, son.  It's not your fault that you couldn't find it.  Come on, your mother wants you to help her in the kitchen.
Okay dad.  I'm comin' . . .
Steven!  Stop that!  It's not done yet!
Oh, come on!  I'm starving!  When will it be ready?
The same time as it is every other day!  6 o'clock, and you know it!  Now shoo!
All right.  I'll be in my study . . . until 6 o'clock.
I'm gonna be a doctor when I grow up!
If you keep doing well in school, I don't see why not.
You really think so?
Of course, dear.  I'm sure you'd be a wonderful doctor.
I'm sorry, Sarah . . . I couldn't find it.  I looked and looked . . .
My poor baby.  This would have kept you warm at the circus.
Steven, why do you do this to yourself?
I just miss her, Diane.  I miss her a lot.
We all do, honey.  But torturing yourself watching old video tapes every night isn't the answer.  Come to bed, it's getting late.
I guess you're right.
You found it!  You found it!  Come on!!  There's not much time!  Follow me!
Come on, slow poke!  She's waiting!  You have to hurry!!
Oops!  Sorry about that!  C'mon in, hurry up!  What are you waiting for?
You found it . . . after all these years.
{N} I'm sorry it took so long . . . I'm so sorry!
Don't be sad, Max.  .
{N} I thought . . . I thought I let you down when you needed me most.
No . . . don't think that.  You could never let me down.  You're my hero.
{N} H- Hero?
You're trying to save all those kids . . . I know you can do it!  I love you.
{N} I love you too.
The local authorities are becoming increasingly suspicious of events here at the asylum. To ensure that my research continues unabated, I must rewrite the locking code for the back lab, and move the subjects' bodies down to the crematorium before the sheriff arrives for an inspection.
The chalkboards must also be washed clean, for they contain the encrypted codes needed to - Dr. Morgan!  We looked everywhere . . . but we ain't been able to find him! What?!  That's the third time this week! But he . . . I mean . . . Maybe he - Spare me your insight!  You're pathetic!  A man cannot vanish into - Please . . . a little thing . . . Both of you, get this wretch out of here!  He's too damned old for my purposes!
As for our missing patient, I'll find him myself!! What about 'dis stuff?  Shouldn't we oughta clean up here?  Before the inspection - I'm aware of it!  We'll take care of this mess after we find him!
Oh please . . . please God . . . let him wake up . . .
His life signs are stable, but we don't know if . . .
Max . . . if you can hear me . . . there's someone here to see you . . .
Max . . . it's me, Morgan . . . I'm right here . . .
You look tired, why don't you get some rest.
Thank you . . .
Don't worry, I'll watch over him . . .
You've done some incredible work, Max . . . it's really a shame . . .
I stand at a crossroads. Shall I venture forth, to unravel the mysteries that lurk beneath the mundane flesh, or turn back in fear of what I may find? At times I feel as though the weight of the world rests upon my weary shoulders. Lacking any sense of direction, I have blindly followed in the footsteps of those who walked before me.
Valiant though my intentions may have been, I was powerless to stem the tide of insanity that washed against the shores of the asylum. Although conventional medicine has yielded a few encouraging results, I see no indication that an answer will be found using those methods. The time for conservative medicine has passed, and a new approach is necessary.
Outside of the mainstream, with scalpel in hand and hope in my heart, I now prepare to tread upon the virgin soil of the mind. No longer bound by the archaic standards of traditional medicine, I feel reborn.
Experiments one and two were complete failures. Unexpected complications during my exploration into the brains of the test subjects regrettably cost them their lives. The loss of a few lives is negligible when compared to the benefits that a cure may bring. Obviously I was in err when I thought the root of insanity grew from the brain itself.
Housed elsewhere within the complex frame of the human body lies the key....but where? There are so many dark avenues to explore that I hardly know where to begin. Humbled by this daunting task, I need time to regroup before I renew my search for this elusive prey. Years of research have taught me to be patient, else all could be lost in a reckless pursuit for the solution.
I search in vain for the elusive solution to this, a most intriguing puzzle. Evading me the way a mouse does a cat, the source of insanity remains hidden from me. Darting from flesh to muscle, muscle to bone, and back again to the fortress of the mind, this evil seems to always maintain one step ahead of me.
How can I trap what I cannot see? Surely I am close to the source by now! Eventually it must rest, and when it does, I will be there to ensnare this beast! Once removed from its host, I am confident that it will wither and die like the weed that it is.
Knowing now how difficult it is to find this hidden monster, I am led to believe that the age of my test subjects may be a factor. Younger subjects tend to display less evidence of infection. The madness is so entrenched within their aged frames of my older subjects that it is nearly impossible to discern the sane tissue from the insane.
{N} A book on the Aztecs.  There are slips of paper marking some pages.
{N} 'Their cosmic structure was simple.  Earth below, in the form of twin mountains.  The sun and stars above.  Over these, another world exists, one beyond this life.'  There's a number one written next to this passage.
{N} Someone wrote the number two here.  'The sunrise figured largely into Aztec culture.
{N} The number three is written on this page.  'In this carving, the sun in the valley represents a king on his throne.  A small circle at the bottom of the hieroglyph symbolizes the king's subject and the world at his feet.'  Looks like there was a picture, but it's been ripped out.
{N} Number four is written here.  'Aztec culture emphasizes visual components.  Thus, the image of an eye wide open is repeated often in wall carvings.'
{N} Number five is written next to this passage.  Spoken rituals, visual elements, even the placement of participants all conformed to the balance between two states.'
I was Jeddah Driscoll in life . . . punished for my crimes . . . now accursed . . . never to rest . . . until my head is returned to my body . . .
Give me back my head!
Active only in newborns, DNAV goes on to deform, cripple, and kill victims within a few years.
Today the world mourns as children who successfully responded to the HOPE drug begin to die.
MERCy corporation stocks continue to rise as the HOPE drug treatment is being used worldwide.
Researchers across the globe report slow progress in developing a true cure for DNAV.
Hon, you're not going to believe it . . . I've found the answer!!  All those years . . . I should have seen it!  There's more . . . I'll tell you when I get home.    Love you.
Move yer asses!  Come on!  That generator is going to blow any minute!
Hey, what about this one?
Aaa, leave him.  That's the bastard who stole some nurse's car.
What's happening?  Wh . . . where am I?

Well, Max, I don't know how but you've found me.  But you're too late!  I'm leaving now, leaving you here with the rest of the dead people.
Damn you, Morgan!
Scrrreeeeeeech!!  Yeeeeeaaaaaagghhh!!
After long ages of waiting, the time has come!  Today you assemble as outsiders, invaders; tomorrow your troops will sweep down upon the city in a murderous wave of retribution!
For too long you have known suffering, you have dwelt beneath the surface and watched your aggressors live in lands where you once lived.  Will you remain underground forever?  Can you endure this terrible injustice for one more day?
Though I am one of them,  I too have been oppressed by your enemy!  They laughed at me, and my work . . .  The very work which has given you your new cybernetic enhancements!    The technology which will mow down all opposition in the coming war!    The work which will allow you to overrun the capital city of Gronterra and assume your rightful place as rulers of this planet . . . your planet!
Your time has come!!  Tomorrow's end will see the end of the cyclopean age, and the dawn of the insectoids!!
Take  my advice, that harness you're wearing won't get you past every security device.  You might want to see the cyber-technician for an upgrade.
Thank you for freeing us, Max.  Now that Mother is destroyed, the children are slowly returning to normal.  They've all gone through the tunnel to join the rest of the world.  I waited for you . . .
Yes, but . . . where are we going?
Immortal.
{N} Grenesir.
{N} What's happening to me?
On you way home, beware the pit of darkness.  You can only pass through safely when you have sought out the wand, flask, and reflection!
Why struggle, Max?  The end will come soon.
Soon the poison will reach your veins, Max, and it will all be over.
Seek the truth . . .
You are truly a great warrior.
You have the strength.
You're my hero.  I love you.
You've come far, Max.  But I'm afraid it ends here, old friend.  As for these , you won't need them any longer.   You've failed the children of the world, as you failed your sister when she needed you most.
You don't have the courage to save them . . .  nor the strength to do what's necessary.  You've failed everyone.    As I've told you countless times before, Max, you've always been your own worst enemy.
Ahh . . . it is . . . no . . . it is so dark.  Oh my home . . . once bright tower, what has become of you?
You . . . you're alive!   Am I going mad?
Listen!  Hear the cries of the children!  The innocent are dying and you only think of yourself?  Can you not see that the light of heaven has dimmed?
What . . . what can I do?
Seek the truth!
Enough games, Max!  This ends here . . . now!  Do you know that the poison will soon condemn you to darkness forever?!  Lost to your doomed world . . . lost to your wife . . . lost to your unborn CHILD!!
NNOOOOOO!!
Nooo!!
It's over.
I'm back.  It's over.
. . . For richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do you part.
...recent unexplained child deaths worldwide.  Experts are baffled as to the cause of these deaths, which leaves us to wonder:  Can anyone put a stop to the loss of our children?

Max...
Sarah would like to see you now.
Oh my God . . .
Welcome back to the states, Max!  I've already managed to assemble a team of top researchers at MERCy.  But I'm especially glad that you finally decided to accept my offer . . . Doctor Laughton!
Ah, my spirit has been so dry!  I do not know you sir, but I thank you.  What is your greatest wish?
I... wish that I could see my sister again.
Max?  Max?  Max, Sarah would like to see you now.
Hey squirt!  Feeling any better?
I don't think I can go to the circus this year.
We'll go next year!
Can you do me a favor, Max? . . . Dolly . . . the one dad won for me last year at the circus . . . Mr. Clown.  Could you get it for me . . . in the toy box?
Oh yeah! Sure!
Where is it?
Where is it?!
I can't find it, Sarah!  I can't...
I can't find it.
I can't find it.
Do you, Jennifer, take this man, Max, to be your lawfully wedded husband?
I do...breathe fire, that's right.  What's your name, little girl?
Step on up to the sign, twerp!  Spanky will say if ya goes in or not!
Har har!  Throw this one back in the water, Spanky, she's too small!!
Okay, shrimp-o, step up to the sign and Spanky will . . .
What the . . .?!  Huh.  I guess you're okay, stretch.
(Sarah whispers) Thank you.
What?!  What am I doing here?! . . .  Who am I?!    Get this off me . . . out . . . I want out!!
A broken piece of mirror!
Timber?
Stinks...
Timber?!  Timber?!  Did you find your bone?
Grrrrr . . . found them.  Rrrrrrr but something smells bad.
What is it?  What's wrong?
Stinks . . . grrrrrrrotten like death.  Rrrrmust leave!!  Have to climb out!!
Timber!!
Dad!!  This is my secret hiding place!  You're not allowed up here!
Hmm.  Tell you what.  I'll turn this thing off if you give me a big hug.
Wweeelllll . . . okay.   As long as you don't tell Max where this is!
Okay, okay . . . now where's that hug?
Love you, Daddy!
Love you too, pumpkin!
Impressive, isn't it?
Yes.
The artist really captured his strength in this pose.  I'd introduce you to him, but he's . . . umm . . . visiting my mother.  She's been feeling run down lately, so my father thought it best that she get some rest at the clinic . . .   I guess we should be going, we don't -
Jacob?  I wasn't expecting you.  I assumed with finals coming up next week that you'd be spending your time in the library.  Instead I find you here, wasting valuable time.
I've more than prepared for the finals, father.  You needn't be concerned.  I'll do just fine.
You'll do just fine?!  Fine?!  Is that your goal?  I thought I taught you better than that.  Anyone can do fine.   I don't want you to be just like every other student that medical school churns out.   Remain focused on what is important, Jacob.
Yes Father.
Damn!!
Here, let me help you.
I'm such an idiot!
Patience is the key, Max.  Never let the problem get the better of you.    You know, I wasn't always this brilliant.
I don't believe you.
Oh, I used to botch my lab tests constantly.  But I stuck with it, and learned from my mistakes.  You're my brightest student, Max, and you have the most potential out of all your classmates.  Now come on, we still have a lot of work to do.
My God . . .   Huh!!
There you are!  Been wandering again?  You know you can't come in here.
I . . . uh . . .
We've been through this before.  If you ever want to get better, you have to let me help you.
I know all this must be confusing to you, even frightening, but this work is going to help so many people.  Sick people . . .
. . .People with no hope.
No!!  Nooo!!
Calm down now!  You're going to hurt yourself!  Those straps can hold a man twice your strength.
Nooooooooo!!!
...and now our breaking story this evening.  During a helicopter sweep in the search for another missing child in the troubled remote community of Warrendale, authorities were startled to discover what appears to be a gigantic insect hive attached to Mt. Cyteria, close to the ancient mechanical ruins.
Details are sketchy at this point, but some sources have estimated that the visible portion of the hive is only a small part of the greater whole.  More details on this breaking story as it develops.
...In an attempt to halt the infestation of the insect horde that is sweeping across our nation, leading entomologist Gromna will lead a team to infiltrate and examine the ever-growing hive.
When asked why he was risking his own life on this mission, Gromna simply replied that he was willing to sacrifice anything to stop the infestation.  When he heard the news, President Agris said, 'Gromna is truly a great man, and we all wish him much success.'
...Today the nation breathed a collective sigh of relief as word from Gromna finally reached our closest outpost to the hive.  Gone for months and presumed dead, it turns out that Gromna's team is not only alive, but that they have found a method to slow the Horde's infestation!  Remaining near the hive, the team will continue their research in an attempt to stop the Horde permanently.
Hi Gravin, I guess you're not in...you must be out helping Gromna 'save the world' or something . . .  . . . I just wanted to tell you that I love you and I miss you . . .   . . . and I really look forward to you coming back to me soon.    Good bye, sweetheart.
Faaathhheerrr . . .
Hello, my children.  Yes, father is here . . .
Faaathhheerrr . . .
Father is here . . .
Faathheerr!!  Faathheerr!!
Yes, my children . . .
Dr. Morgan?  What test is this?
Ah, Max!  You're just in time!  This is a test of the subject's . . . threshold.  The serum will travel directly to the neurotransmitters of the brain, and without actually harming the monkey, cause it to feel excruciating pain all over its body.
What?!  That's not an experiment!  It's torture!!  What possible purpose -
When you outrank me in lab years, Max, you can question the methods.  I see the potential fruits of our research, and that justifies the means.    A valuable lesson in scientific research, Max.  In layman's terms:  You can't make an omlette without breaking a few eggs.
Treatment?  What treatment?
A treatment - they've found a way to slow down the disease!  It says here that a Dr. Morgan was 'ultimately responsible for developing the DNAV treatment.  Didn't you study with a Dr. Morgan back in med school?
I was still a sophomore when he earned his doctorate.
Well, the treatment's called 'HOPE' ... it's supposed to decelerate the growth of the DNAV, almost doubling the life span of affected children!
The Aztecs found a way to survive the 'Plague of Quetzalcoatl' without conventional modern medicine...Hey, if Morgan is close to a cure - a true cure - then maybe he can use another set of hands.  Maybe it's time to pack up here and go home.
Yes . . . this ought to do it.
DNA test cycle initiated.
Perfect.  Exactly, now -   NO!!
Molecular cohesion negative.
Damn it!
Could it be?  My God!  That's it!  All along . . . the answer has been here, right in front of my eyes the whole time!!
What the hell are you doing?
Excuse me?
Cutting my research department in half, pulling most of my funding despite the fact that my department . . . my research is coming remakably close to a cure!!
Oh, your research . . .  May I remind you that the MERCy foundation was created around the success of my HOPE drug, not vague promises of a cure.  Rather than wasting resources on an entirely new path, you need to channel your energies towards making the HOPE drug better.
I thought that a few cutbacks would communicate this to you - maybe you're not as bright as I thought.
You know, I think I've figured you out.  You're not interested in a cure.  You just want HOPE to bring you more prestige, more money.  You smug bastard.  Give me back my department.  Otherwise I'll . . .   I'll leave!  I'll take my research with me and find a company that is more concerned with finding a cure than filling its pockets.
I . . . I can't believe that your opinion of me is so low, Max.  We're friends.  You're blowing the whole thing out of proportion, taking this personally.  Your sister didn't die of DNAV, Max.
I'm . . . I apologize.
No, it's all right. . .    Those cutbacks are based solely on existing statistics.  The truth is that it's difficult to measure the success of your research against the proven methods of the HOPE treatment.  Look, you don't have to leave MERCy to continue with your project.  I'll look over the numbers again.  We'll work something out.
Quetzalcoatl, our King.  Ruthless and just, he led our warriors to many victories.  The Shaven Head Otonmi were feared by many, and life in the village was good.
At his death, Quetzalcoatl's power was mighty.  Upon reaching the heavens, he took his place as a God.  But unhappy was he.  With nothing new to conquer, he became restless and sought to return to his people as King.
Fearful of this hateful God, the people refused to offer sacrifice.  Enraged at this affront to his majesty, Quetzalcoatl unleashed his unholy fury on our village.
The Temple of Water, divine portal to our Goddess of the Sea, was flooded by the terrible storm that raged for seven days . . .
. . . and for seven nights did the earth shake its mighty fist, crushing the Temple of the Wind and many villagers beneath great falling rocks.
Alone against these elements stood the Temple of the Jaguar, its strength unyielding to water and earth.  Quetzalcoatl now seeks the power of fire to destroy it, reaching deep into the ground to bring forth the earth's blood.
Seeking the strength of the Jaguar, the people pray for the coming of their protector, Olmec, guardian of the faithful.  He alone can spare our village from the doom that Quetzalcoatl summons.
Huh!
You must be the Stone Mason's daughter.  Your parents miss you greatly.  I will take you home.
Oooo!
Mmmmm . . . YAAAAHHHHH!!
Ha ha ha!    Mmm . . . HAAHHHHHH!!
Hunh? . . .   AAAAIIIIEEEEEE!!    Olmec . . .
Could it be?   . . . all this time . . . so simple . . .
DNA test cycle initiated.
Come on . . . come on . . . hold together you son of a bitch!!
Molecular cohesion affirmative.
YESSSS!!
Test cycle downloaded to DVD.  Encryptor sequence completed.  System shutdown activated.
Oh, my poor baby!  You had an awful fall!    I'm so glad you've come home.
Home?
Well of course, silly!  You did want to come home, didn't you?
Yes . . . I wanted to -
Then that's that!  Hush now, Max!  When you fell down the chimney, you bumped your head and now you're a little confused, that's all!
My . . . my head hurts.  I remember hitting it . . .
That's right, dear.  You hit your head on the chimney.  Now don't give it another thought.  I'll take care of you.
Chimney?  No . . . I hit it . . . no, I hit it on . . . in . . . my . . . my car?
No, of course not, dear!  You just bumped -
Yes, my car!  I was driving and . . . the brakes . . .
But Max, we've been waiting for you for so long!  Don't leave now!!
We?  . . .  Who?
Why, me and little Sarah, of course!    Who else would it be, silly?
But that's imposs . . .  Sarah's de-
Saarraahhhh!!  Max is home!!
S . . . Sarah?
Max!!  You're home!!  You're home!!  I've missed you!!
You're alive!!   My God, Sarah . . . you're . . .
NNNOOOOO!!  You're dead!!
Hee hee hee!
Naughty, naughty boy!!
Your tenacity is quite remarkable, you know.  Your doctor tells me that you should have died in the car wreck . . .   I wish things could have worked out differently, Max, but . . .  . . . they didn't.
You leave me little choice, old friend.  Did you honestly expect me to sit by while you went public with your cure?  No . . . I've worked much, much too hard to allow that.    I guess this is goodbye, Max.  I'm truly sorry it had to end like this.  Farewell.
Can you hear me? It's Dr. Morgan.  Your delusions almost took the life from you this time.
My face, it's in bandages.  Where am I?  Who . . . am . . . I?
You must have thought you had somewhere important to go when you stole that car.
Oh, no . . .
You did a lot of damage to that face of yours in the crash.
I'm sorry . . . I . . . I can't believe . . .
No apologies.  All we need is your best effort.  And before you can give us that, you need some rest.  Bruce, help our lad back to his room.  Don't worry son, we'll talk again soon.
Hey!  You big dope!  Get out of our light!
Come on, Billy.  Let's play!   You're not s'posed to -
OK, OK.
Hon, you're not going to believe it . . . I 've found the answer!!  All those years . . . I should have seen it!  There's more . . . I'll tell you when I get home.
{N} Looks like you're all done planting your seeds.  Can I borrow your shovel now?
Go ahead!  I'm all done!  Mother will be so proud of me when she wakes up!
That's OK.  You can have it when I'm done.
You fool!!  You cannot touch me!  In death I have gained much power!  The souls of the Shaven head Otonmi feed my magic!!
Coatlicue!  My daughter!  You have returned from death!
{N} Fool!  She was trapped within the temple!  Had you not been so stubborn and full of self-pity you would have realized that!
Oh, my precious daughter!  I am so sorry!! Go see your mother, she misses you terribly.
{N} I have found your daughter, mason.  It is time for me to undergo the Rite of the Warrior.
You are truly honorable, Olmec.  Please find it in your heart to forgive me.  I should never have doubted you -
{E} Enough groveling, chieftain!  Get on with it!!
Y- yes . . . of course!  There are two stages to the ritual.  The first is an act of bravery and heroism.  You've already shown that by returning my daughter to me.  Second, you must recite the names of the warriors who have come before you in order of their lineage.
{N} I have the Pod of Might, old one.  Here ... work your magic.
Very good.  Thank you, sacred one.  I will begin at once.
I go to fulfill my destiny.  May my sacrifice save the village.
Blood of the holy . . .  Flesh of the warrior . . .  Married to the heart of the land in a union of protection and power . . .  Hear my prayers for divine conjuring . . .  Bring forth the sacred magicks of the deep earth to shield this noble warrior from the harsh elements!!
It is done. Go forth and fulfill your destiny, Olmec.  The fate of our village lies in your hands.
That looks like a red herring.  I appreciate the gift, but I haven't much use for it.  When my husband found them in his nets, he would curse his luck.  He claimed they are useless things that simply take up space.
Well, Max, I don't know how you've found me. But you're too late! I'm leaving now, leaving you here with the rest of the dead people.
Damn you, Morgan!

Morgan's Last Game
There once was a man
who planted a tree,
And spoke to it daily
in reverent rhymes.
Before the man died,
he shared it with me,
The rhyme I have spoken
to the tree many times.
Approach it with caution
and whisper these words :
Speak to me tree,
lest your eyes nest with birds!
{N} Excuse me.  Do I know you?  Your name is. . . .
Martin.  Martin I said.
{N} Do you know. . .  Do you know who. . . .  Can you tell me my name?
How the hell should I know.  How can you stand all of them, buzzing, constantly buzzing!
{N} Martin, that's your name, isn't it?
Martin, yes, of course, what of it?
{N} What is this place?
A nuthouse, you fool.
{N} A nuthouse?  It looks so old . . .  What do you mean?
Nuthouse.  Loony bin.  Funny farm.  What don't you understand?
{N} Well.  There's a lot I don't understand . . .  For starters, why are you here?
Damned bugs are driving me crazy.  But I'll find their hive one day.  Doc Morgan's a great help.  We'll squash 'em, and that'll be that!
{N} What bugs, Martin?  I don't see any.  Maybe they're not real . . .
Are you serious?  These blood sucking insects are bent on destroying the world!
{E} Martin, think about it.  How are some bugs going to destroy the world?
Well look at them!  These aren't normal bugs.  These is robots!  Little, eeeny, teeny robots!
{N} There's a Doctor around here, Doc Morgan?
Ex-ter-min-a-tor!  That's what he is, the best there is.  He kills bugs dead.  But they always come back.   They always come back.
{N} Where is everyone?
Cowards, all of them.  When the alarm went off, they left us behind.  Probably in on it with the bugs.  Wait 'til Doc Morgan finds out!  It's a conspiracy.
{N} Why is the alarm going off?  What's happening?
The bugs, of course.  Damned little bastards blew up the power generator.  They unlocked the doors, let the nuts out.  Crazies roamin' free.  Ahh, the bugs were bad enough!
{E} I wish someone would turn the alarm off.  I can't think straight.
And you think turning the alarm off will help?  Ahh, there's a switch around here somewhere.
{N} A generator blew up?
Are you deaf or something?  Yeah, the generator.  It powered the tower.  Big thing. . . fire, flame, fuel, heats things, stuff happens, and zing. . . ya got power.  Don't you know how things work?
{N} Can I ask you something?  Can I ask your name?
D- da- da- Don!  I haven't heard you before.  Wh- who are you?
{N} I wish I knew.  I- I can't remember my name.  I was hoping you might know me.
Stupid voice.  Are you a sp- sp- spirit?
{N} I'm no spirit, just a man.  Like you.
Like me!  Th- th- then you c- c- an hear the voices too!?  C- can't you?
{N} I'm not sure . . .  These voices, spirits, ghosts, whatever they are . . .  Who are they?
The fallen warriors!!  They demand vengeance!
{N} What is it they're demanding vengeance for?
T-t-temples, the fallen temples!  C-c-can't you hear them?  C-c-crying out!
{N} Is this the temple?  Is this place one of the fallen temples?
N-n-n-n-no!  If you don't k-know-know that, you're not the w-w-w-warrior I thought you to be.
{N} Hi Don, remember me?
Yeah.  The stu- stupid voice.
{N} Something here is familiar.  I keep thinking I'll get it. . . .  Where are we?
I know something that you don't.  Th-this is the-the v-village.  S-stupid voice.
{N} What village?  Doesn't this place have a real name?
Of- of course.  It's the Village, the b- b- best place for people like you and me.  The doctor here has resource-resource-re-s-s . . . he's very good!  Dr. Morgan.  He s-s-says I'm lucky to be here, and so you must be l- l- lucky, too.  Good for you.  Well done!
{N} How can I find this Dr. Morgan?  I think I need to talk to him.
He'll find you.  The b-b-b-best witch doctor in the land, he is.  He'll save us!
{E} Can you tell me where anyone is, Dr. Morgan. . . anyone?
They f-fled.  Cowards, n-n-not-not great warriors like us.  Oh, but not Morgan.  He'll f- find us.
{N} Why are you in this place?  What brought you here?
Isn't it obvious?  Hid-d-d-ding from Him!
{N} Him?  I don't -
Sh-sh-shut up, or He'll hear you!  Stupid voice.
{N} What happened to set the alarm off?
It's c-calling us to war!  The village is under attack!
{N} OK, we know we're under attack, now how do I turn that alarm off?
Wh wh- why would you want to?
{N} Hello.  I don't believe I know you.  What's your name?
Lenny.  I'm Lenny.  Lenny's my name.
{N} Well then.  You must be Lenny.  You wouldn't happen to know my name, would you?
Nope.  Mom says not to talk to strangers.
{H} Hey, Lenny, it's me.
Yep.  It's you all right.
{N} Lenny, do you know where we are?
This is my room, my bedroom.  Do you like it?
{N} Bedroom?  No, I mean the building.  What's this place we're in; what's it called?
My house.
{E} This isn't your house!
Yes it is!
{N} Why are you here, Lenny?  Can you tell me that?
I was very, very bad.
{N} Bad?  I can't believe that of you, Lenny.  What did you do?
I, uh. . . . I ate some pumpkin pie.
{N} Pie?  How could you get in trouble for that?
It came from the patch.
{N} A pumpkin patch?  Where is it?  Where--
Aaaiiiiieee!!!
{N} Where is everyone, Lenny?
Where you should be.  You should listen.  Mother made them all go away.
{N} I must not have heard her.  Lenny, where did she tell them to go to?
To school.  Yeah, she made them go to school.
{N} Since I didn't hear your mom, can you tell me how to get to school?
Eeeeeee!!
{N} Why is there an alarm going off?  What's happening?
Mother's coming!  Mother's coming!
{H} Who are you, young lady?
My name's Jessie Hatcher.  What's yours?
{N} I . . . I can't remember my name.
Well, mother won't let me talk to strangers so you'd better leave.
{H} Where's your mother?  I'd really like to speak to her.
Mother is everywhere.
{N} Your name is Jessie, right?
Mmm hmmm.  The tic-tac-toe champion!  What's your name?
{N} My name is Max.
Oh.  That's a dumb name.
{E} That's a rude thing to say!  What would your parents say if they heard you talk like that?
Hmph!  They're not here, and you're not my dad.  I don't have to listen to you!
{E} Where are your parents?
They're all in . . .
Jessie!  Shut up!  He's a grownup!  You know Mother's rule!
{N} What's mother's rule?
We . . . we aren't s'posed to talk about our folks.  If we do, we'll be put in . . . in  . . . the patch.
{N} The patch?  What's that?
A bad place.
{N} Where are we?  What's the name of this town?
Go look at the big sign.
{N} Jessie, this might sound weird, but have you ever seen the angel statue move?
Quit kiddin' around, mister!
{S} No, really . . . it folded its wings around me and brought me here from far away -
Yeah, right.  I'm 8 years old, not some dumb kid!
{N} I haven't seen any adults around.  Where are they?
{N} What game are you playing?
Tic-tac-toe.  Wanna play?  I'm the best there is!
{N} Can you tell me how to play?
Well, you put an X and I put down an O.  In the boxes here.  The idea is to get three across, or up and down, or diag'nal.  If you do that, you win.
{N} Let's play a game.  Then we'll see if you're as good as you say.
Ha!  You prob'ly think you're smart, but you're just a big, stupid boy.
{N} Aw.  You got lucky.
Uh-uh!  You stink!   All boys are stupid!  Thhhpppptttt!!
{H} I guess you're not as good as you thought, Jessie.
Hmph!  I let you win, 'cuz you're new in town.  You're pretty smart, though - for a boy.  I've only been beaten a couple of times before, but that's 'cuz they were all girls.  Girls are a lot smarter than boys!
Nuh-uh!  Girls is stupider!
Shut up Billy, you little retard!
{N} Which girls have beaten you?
Meg and Eileen . . . they're her bestest friends.
{N} Meg told me that she's beaten you at your game 4 times. Is that true?
Yeah.  OK.  I guess Meg did beat me a few times.
{N} I thought you were the 'champeen', Jessie?  Eileen said she whipped your butt at this game.  She told me that she beat you seven times!
Liar!  Liar!  Pants on fire!  She only beat me 4 times!
What about last Thursday?
That didn't count!  It started to rain!
Did so!  She put down her X before it all washed away.
Fine!  But she only beat me 5 times, not seven.
{E} All right.  Let's try that again.
OK!  Now I'll really beat ya!
{N} I don't mean to be rude, but . . .  What happened to your face?
Huh?  Oh that!  Mother did this!  Aren't I pretty?  I hope to be as pretty as Mother when I grow up!  Don't you think I'm pretty?
{N} Sure, um, yes.  You're very, very pretty, Jessie.  My God, what's going on here?
{N} Tell me about the pumpkin patch, Jessie.  What's so special about it?
No one goes in there . . . unless they were bad, like Maria!  It's a bad, bad place!
{N} There's a lock on the pumpkin patch gate.   Do you know the combination, Jessie?
I asked Mother once and she told me that the answer has somethin' to do with losing stuff.  I didn't understand that though, 'cuz I'm good at remembering where I put my stuff.  Not like stupid Billy!  He forgets where he puts stuff all the time!
I do not, you big boogerhead!
Do too!
{E} Yes, I know about 'Mother'.  I've seen her - she's not human!  Don't you understand what she's --
Mother is good.  Mother is the way.  Mother protects us from the meat who would harm us.  The meat must be destroyed so that the seedlings can grow.  We are all Mother's seedlings.
{E} Meat?!  What are you talking about?
Don't be so silly, Max.  You know!  Everyone knows, even my dumb brother knows.  Meat!  Meat is bad . . . that's why Mother is changing us.
{E} What is she doing to you?  What do you mean 'changing'?
Making us into seedlings of course!
{S} Seedlings?!  But you're a child, a human child -
That's the whole point!  Mother says she'll be able to finish the change soon, too.  Ooo, I can't wait!  I'll be such a pretty flower.  Don't you think so, Max?
{N} Yes.  Very pretty.
So Meg beat me 4 times, Eileen beat me 5 times.  But you only beat me once, Mister Smarty-pants.
{H} Hey, um, kid.  What's your name?
My name's Billy.  What's yours?
{N} I . . . I can't remember my name.
Well, mother won't let me talk to strangers so you'd better leave.
{H} Where's your mother?  I'd really like to speak to her.
Mother only talks to us kids, not a big poophead like you.
{N} You're Billy, right?
Uh huh, I told you that a zillion times already!  Gees!  Have you figured out your name yet, Mister No-Name?
{N} My name is Max.
Oh.  That's a good name.  Better than Mister No-name.  I used to have a goldfish named Max, but my cat ate it.   He pooped orange for two days!
{N} That's disgusting!  Do your parents know you tell stories like that?
Yeah, but they don't say anything.  Orange poop!  Orange poop!
{E} Where are your parents?
I'm not s'posed to tell, says Mother.
{H} You can tell me.  I'm your friend, right?
{N} Where are we?  What's the name of this town?
You are standing in the boogertown capital of poopyland!  Poopy-stinky-doo-doo-
{E} Enough, Billy!
Aww!  You're no fun!
{N} Billy, that angel statue over there . . .  Does it . . .  I mean, have you ever seen it move, very often?
Stupid Mister Orange-poop.  You must have boogers for brains!  Statues don't move!
{S} Well this one did.  It was . . .  Didn't you see it?  It carried me here from far away.  I mean, it just wrapped its wings around me and -
Stop it mister, you're givin' me the creeps!
{N} I haven't seen any adults around.  Where are they?
{N} What game are you playing?
Tic-tac-toe.  Jessie's the best there is.   Except when she cheats.
{H} She's the best, huh?  Maybe I could play, too.  Got any tips for me?
Yeah, stupid-head.  Don't lose.
{E} I don't have much patience for games but I've got less patience for smart-mouth kids like you.
{N} I don't mean to be rude, but . . .  What happened to your face?
Me?  Nuthin'!  Mother says I'm handysome.   What's wrong with your face, mister?  Is Mother making you handysome, too?
{N} Um, no Billy.  I was hurt in an accident.  These bandages help me get better.
{N} Jessie's pretty good at that game.
I told you she was good!  She beats me all the time!
{H} Jessie's pretty good at that game.  But I just beat her.
No duh, boogerface!  I was sittin' right here watching!
{E} Next time maybe you should watch your mouths instead.
{E} Yes, I know about 'Mother'.  I've seen her - she's not human!  Don't you understand what she --
Mother is good.  Mother is the way.  She protects us from the meat.  The meat's gotta be destroyed so the seedlings can grow.  That's us, the seedlings.  We're all Mother's seedlings.
{E} Meat?!  What are you talking about?
Me, you, everyone.  Mother says we're all just meat.  And meat is sick, it's poopy bad.  She's gonna change us so we're good, like her.
{E} What is she doing to you?  What do you mean 'changing'?
You know, mister.  Change meat into seedlings.  Make us just like her, once she feels better.  She's gonna finish what she started and make us good, make us big and strong!  Boy!  I can't wait!
{N} Why didn't Mother finish your changes yet?
After she made all the 'dults go away, she said that she was too weak to help us.  So now we're just waiting 'til she gets strong again.  She said any day now . . .
{S} Seedlings?!  But you're a child, a human child --
Not for long, though.  Mother says she'll be able to finish the change real soon . . .  Boy oh boy, I can't wait!  I'm gonna be big and strong, not just a little kid anymore!
{N} This girl's eyes are missing.  Was she in some sort of accident?  Excuse me, little girl, but could I talk to you for a second?
Sure, mister.  I don't get many visitors.
{N} May I ask your name?
My name is Maria . . . Maria Santiago.
{N} You're Maria, right?
That's right . . . Maria Santiago.
{N}Where are we?  What's the name of this town?
There is no town.  Not anymore.
{N} What do you mean, not anymore?
There was a town, before Mother got here.  People were happy . . .  Everything was fine . . .
{N} Before your mother came to town?  What do you mean?
You're new here . . . you just don't understand.
{N} No, I don't understand.  You're only confusing me more . . .  Could you explain it to me, start at the beginning?
I'm sorry.  If you want to really understand what's going on, I think that there're lots of newspapers and stuff in the town hall.  But I haven't seen them . . .  Come back in a little while and we'll talk some more.  I'd show you the way to the town hall, but my eyes . . .
{N} That's OK . . . thank you.  I guess, um, I'll see you later.
{N} I'm sorry, Maria, but I haven't had time to read any of the newspapers yet.
That's OK.  I'm not going anywhere.  I'll be here whenever you want to talk about them.
{N} I've read the old newspapers in the Town Hall, Maria.
Oh good!  You found it.  What do you want to talk about now?
{N} I haven't seen any adults in this town.  Where are they?  Where are your parents?
I'm sorry, but Mother has forbidden us to talk about them.
{N} I keep hearing about 'Mother', but it doesn't sound like she's anyone's real mother.  Who is this person?
She's resting right now . . . otherwise I wouldn't speak to you.  You're right, though . . . she isn't anyone's real mother!  She's really . . .
{S} What is it Maria?
I think she's waking up!  I can't talk anymore!  Mother will hear me and get awful mad!
{E} But . . . oh, damn it!
{E} Forbidden?  But why?  Why can't you talk about your parents?
Please don't be mad!  I'd tell you if I could, it's just that . . . well . . . I'll be punished again if I do.
{N} Punished how?
The pumpkin patch.  She'll have me put in the pumpkin patch again.  It's a terrible place.
{N} It doesn't look so bad from here.
Once you're inside . . . everything turns bad.
{N} You've been in there before?
Yes.  The others dragged me in there.
{N} The other children?
They did as they were told.  Mother wanted to teach me a lesson.
{N} What lesson, Maria?
Not to look for our parents.  Mother said we should never, ever do that . . . but I was too curious.  Mother saw me.  She told the other kids that I was bad.  Then she made them put me in the patch.  I don't remember much . . . just those nasty birds, black wings, they pecked at my eyes . . .  It hurt a lot!  But when the birds were done, Mother took the pain away.
{E} That's . . . that's horrendous!  How could she do such a thing to a child?!
It's OK . . . it's not so bad now.  I'm kinda used to it.  Anyway, once Mother wakes up, everything will be better.
{E} OK?!  What do you -
Please . . . I don't wanna talk about it anymore.  I've already said too much.
{N} What's the deal with this pumpkin patch?  There's a lock on the gate.
To keep everyone out!  It's a bad, bad place.
{N} Why is it so bad?  It's a little overgrown, but it looks OK -
It's dangerous!  Mother grew it to keep us kids away while she rests.  She said that us kids should stay outside 'til she's rested and ready to play with us.
{N} If she wants you to stay outside, then that means she's inside . . . right?  But inside where?  All I see is the pumpkin patch and the . . . barn . . .  She's in the barn, isn't she Maria?
I'm not supposed to tell . . . I mean . . . yes.
{N} So I need to go through the pumpkin patch to talk to Mother . . . but first I have to get past the gate.
But it's locked.
{N} Do you know the combination?
No . . . but I heard Mother tell Jessie that the numbers are 'in her loss'.  Do you know what that means?
{N} I'm not sure . . . I'll have to think about it.
{N} The newspapers mention a preacher, named O'Toole . . . did you know him?
Yes.  He was real scared about the comet.  I remember him saying at church that God was mad about the pumpkins, and that he was gonna punish us for taking advantage of the land.
{N} A comet . . . is that what happened here?  Did the comet somehow make the plants around here grow so wild?
Mother told us that the comet was a sign of Her coming, a sign that we were special children.
{E} Yes, I know about Mother.  I've seen her - she's not human!  Don't you understand what she -
Mother is . . . good.  Mother is the way.  Mother protects us from . . . meat who would harm us.  The meat must be killed so that the seedlings may grow.  We're all . . . seedlings.
{E} Meat?!  What are you . . .  Maria?  What's wrong with you?
It's too late, Max.  She's strong again . . . as strong as before, when she took all of the adults . . . I . . . I can't think straight.  I . . .  Maria is safe now.  They are all safe.  Soon all of the sickness will be gone, and my seedlings will be one with me, free to live and grow.  You are sick, too, sick with flesh.  You need my help.  Breathe deep, crude meat-thing, and be cleansed.
{N} Who are you?
Meggan Johns.  But you can call me Peg Leg.  That's what all the kids call me.
{N} That's mean!  I would never call you that.
Thanks mister.  You're nice.  What's your name?
{N} I . . . I can't remember my name.
Oh, sorry mister, but I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.  Mother says that it's a bad thing to do.
{H} Is your mother around here somewhere?  I'd like to speak with her.
Mother is everywhere . . . but you can't see her.
{N} You're Meg, right?
Yeah, but you can call me Peg Leg, if you like.  I don't mind.
{N} My name is Max.
That's a nice name . . .  Hey!  Now you aren't a stranger!
{N} Where are we?  What town is this?
This is home, silly!
{E} I realize that this is your home, Meg, but where am I?  I mean, doesn't this town have a name?
Oh!  Didn't you see the sign?
{N} I haven't seen any adults in this town.  Where are your parents?  Where are all of the adults?
Sorry, Max, but Mother won't let us talk about that.
{N} Why is that?
Mother says that all adults 'cept her are bad, and we shouldn't talk to 'em.
{N} Adults are bad?  I don't understand.  Why does your mother distrust all other adults so much?
She says that 'pride leads to their destruction' or somethin' like that.
{N} What does that mean?
I . . . Oh!  I prob'ly said too much already!
{N} You really like to skip rope, huh Meg.  I'm sorry, but . . . doesn't that hurt, with your false legs?
What?  Oh!  My legs . . .  It's okay!  That don't hurt much.  Besides, Mother says that once I'm finished growin' I'll forget all about my legs.
{N} I saw the pumpkin patch.  Why is there a lock on the gate?
To keep everyone out!  No one goes in there!  Those nasty birds will fly in your hair!
{N} Aww, birds won't hurt you if you leave them alone.  They're more afraid of you than you are of them.
These birds are different, mister, I swear!
{N} Do you happen to know the combination for the lock on the gate?
Nope.
{E} That pumpkin patch is dangerous!  Those birds almost gouged my eyes out!  They . . . they could have killed me!
I told you the birds were nasty!  Mother says she feeds 'em special punkin seeds and they protect her while she rests.  She told us that the birds'll keep us kids away 'til she's good and rested.
{N} Hey Meg, I beat Jessie at Tic-tac-toe.  She said that you beat her once, too.
Hah!  I beat her more than once.  I beat her 4 times!
{H} 4 times!  You must be pretty good.
Thanks!
{E} I know about Mother.  I've seen her - she's not human!  Don't you understand what she -
Mother is good.  Mother is the way.  Mother protects us from the meat who would harm us.  The meat must be killed so the seedlings may grow.  We're all Mother's seedlings.
{E} Growing seedlings?!  She's doing something to you, Meg, something very wrong.  Don't you see?!
Oh, Max, don't be such a poop!  Mother is here to take care of us.  Don't worry, soon Mother will change you, too, and make you grow, and . . . and you'll see . . . nothing . . . nothing is wrong.
{E} Meat?!  What are you talking about?!
Mother's going to make us just like her, and we won't be bad anymore.  She says that our bodies are just lumps of sick meat, and she's gonna make us better.  I can't wait!  I'm going to be a pretty rose!
{E} Why would you want to be a rose?  Roses can't jump rope, they can't play tic-tac-toe, they -
I want to be pretty, Max.  I'm tired of bein' fat and ugly.  All the kids make fun of me.  But when Mother wakes up, I'm going to be the prettiest of them all!  You'll see!
{N} But you don't need to -
I thought you were nice but you're just like everyone else!  You want me to be fat and ugly forever so you can make fun of me!  You're just a sick, mean adult!  Leave me alone!!
{N} Hi.  What's your name?
Marty Johns . . . what's your name?
{N} I . . . I can't remember my name.
Sorry.  Mother says I can't talk to strangers because she tol' me not to.
{N} Is your mother around here somewhere?
Mother is everywhere . . . but she's indivisible or something.
{N} OK . . . Can I talk to her?
Uh-uh.  She's restin'.
{N} Do you know when she'll wake up?
Nope.
{N} Hey, you're Marty, right?
Uh-huh.  You 'member things good.  I'm M - A - R - T - Y.  But my sister calls me Mush Head.
{N} Why does your sister call you Mush Head?
Cause she says my head looks like I got put in a blender.
{N} Well that's a rotten thing to say!
Yeah, she's been pretty mean lately.  M - E - E - N.
{N} But she wasn't always mean to you, right?
Naw.  But her legs've been botherin' her.  Whenever they hurt she calls me names.
{N} What's wrong with her legs, Marty?
Well . . . I'm not supposed to talk about it . . . but since Mother started changin' us, weird things happened.  First my face, then Meg's legs kinda shriveled up like . . . uh oh!
{N} What?  What's wrong?
No, I can't!  I hear Mother startin' to wake up!  If she hears me I'll get put in the patch!
{N} What's so bad about that?  I don't -
No!!  I don't wanna talk about this any more!!
{N} But Marty, I -
Aaaaaa!!
{N} My name is Max.
Oh.  I got a cousin named Max.  You have the same name as his.  But you're not my cousin.
{N} Where are we?  What town is this?
This is Genet.  G - E - N - E - T.  I can spell other words, too.
{N} I haven't seen any adults in this town.  Where are your parents?  Where are all of the adults?
Um . . . I have a ball.  I can bounce it.
{H} That sure is a nice ball.  I used to have one just like it.
Really?  This one's mine.
{N} I saw the pumpkin patch.  Why is there a lock on the gate?
Stay out, Mother said!  It's a bad place!  Very bad!  B - A - D.
{N}  OK, Einstein.  Marty, do you know the combination?
Uh-uh, and I don't wanna know it!
{E} That pumpkin patch is dangerous!  Those birds almost gouged my eyes out!  They . . . they could have killed me!
I told you!  B - A - D!  Mother needs to rest so the birds keep us out while she sleeps and stuff.
{E} I know about Mother.  I've seen her - she's not human!  Don't you understand what she -
Mother is good.  Mother is the way.  Mother protects us from the meat.  M - E - E - T.  The meat must be killed so the seedlings can grow.  K - I - L - L.  We're all Mother's seedlings.
{E} Grow?!  Is that what she told you, she's helping you grow?  She's killing you!  She's -
No!  You're lying!!  Mother was right about you adults's!  You're all just like Jeddah!  You're bad meat!!  Mother!!  Maa!!
{E} But Marty!  Wait, I -
Go away!  I don't wanna talk to you!
{N} Why aren't you playing with the others?
I like my ball . . . and rides.  Be careful, mister pig is almost broke.
{N} What's your name?
Well, since all the adults went away, everyone calls me Lumpy . . .
{N} Do you have another name?  A real name?
Well, my real name is Larry, but no one calls me that anymore.  What's your name, mister?
{N} I . . . I can't remember my name.
Oh.  Then I gotta go.  Mother says I ain't allowed to talk to no strangers.
{N} Where is your mother?  Can I talk to her?
Nope.  She's restin'.  Maybe when she wakes up you can see her.
{N} Oh, I see.  Do you know when she'll wake up?
Uh-uh.  No sir.
{N} Everyone calls you Lumpy, right?
Yeah.  It's 'cause of this hump I got, I guess.  Pretty cool, huh?
{N} Umm, yeah.  I guess so, kid.
{N} My name is Max.
It's not as cool as my name, but it's OK.  I guess that means you ain't a stranger no more . . . so I can talk to you, right?
{N} Uh, right.
{N} Where are we?  What town is this?
Gee-neet . . . I think that's what the sign says, but I don't read so good.
{N} I haven't seen any adults in this town.  Where are your parents?  Where are all of the adults?
Mother says we're not s'posed to talk to anyone 'bout that.  'Specially you big people.  Sorry.
{N} I read the town newspapers and saw some articles about a man named Jeddah Driscoll.  Was he your father?
Yeah.
{N} I'm sorry to hear about your mom.  But if she's dead, who is this 'Mother' that you keep talking about?
She's my new mom . . . and she promised me that she won't ever go away.
{N} How can she promise that?  I mean, we all . . . uh . . . 'go away'.
Nuh-uh!  Mother said we'll live forever after she's finished with us!
{N} The newspaper mentioned that you have a sister.  Her name is Carol, right?
Yes.  But I ain't seen her since all the adults went away.  Mother says dad made Carol go away, too.
{N} Dennis told me that Carol is his secret weapon.  Do you know what he's talking about?
Gee, I dunno.  I haven't seen her for almost a year!  Dennis must know somethin' that I don't . . .  I wish he'd tell me where she was hidin'!
{N} I see that you and Carol are . . . um, very close.
Yeah, I'm so happy she's back!  Thanks for helpin' me find her!
{N} Uhh, sure . . . I guess.
{E} I know about Mother.  I've seen her - she's not human!  Don't you understand what she -
Mother is good.  Mother's the way.  She protects us from the meat who would harm us.  The meat must be killed so that the seedlings can grow.  We're all Mother's seedlings.
{E} Seedlings?!  But you're a child . . . a human child -
I'm lonely, mister.  Everyone in my family is gone except me.  Mother is gonna make it all better.
{E} 'Better'?!  Don't you know what that means?!  You'll be 'gone', too!  She's -
Uh-uh!  You're mean!  Just like Mother said you would be!  Go away!!
{N} What's your name?
What's it to ya, dumbass?
{E} Nothing.  Certainly nothing worth getting dunked in the river over, don't you think?
Jeez, mister, don't get all bent out of shape.  I was just kiddin'.  My name's Dennis O'Toole.  What's yours?
{N} I . . . I can't remember my name.
Hmph.  Well, Mother says we ain't supposed to talk to no strangers . . . but she's sleepin so what the hell.
{N} So your mom's sleeping, huh?  Where is she?
That's none of your business.
{N} My name is Max.
Hmph!  That figures!  What a stupid name.
{N} Your name is Dennis O'Toole, right?
That's my name, don't wear it out!
{N} The newspapers mentioned a Reverend O'Toole.  Are you related to him?
Yeah, he's my old man.
{N} I'd like to speak to your father.  Is he close by?
Oh he's really close, but you can't talk to him.
{N} Why not?
Because only Mother is allowed to.
{N} Only mother?  You mean you're not allowed to see your own father?
Yup.  Mother says that they got to learn about raisin' us kids, so we should leave 'em alone.
{N} Alone where?
Hmph!  How dumb do you think I am?  I ain't no squealer!
{N} Is that your father's church across town?
Uh-huh, that's St. Michael's church.
{N} I saw a large cross in the creek.  Is that part of the church?
Boy, for an adult you sure do ask stupid questions!  Of course it is!
{N} But how did it get in the creek?
It was struck by lightning the day before the comet hit.
{N} From what the papers said, it sounded like your dad thought the comet was a sign from God.
Yeah, I guess so.  Mother says that the comet was a sign, too, but not a bad one.  She said God sent it to rescue us.
{N} Rescue you from what?
I ain't allowed to talk about that.  I said too much already.
{N} Where are we?  What town is this?
This dump?  Who cares.  If there's a cool place to be, then we're far from it, as far as you can get.
{N} I haven't seen any adults in this town.  Where are your parents?  Where are all of the adults?
Mother took care of them.  In fact, I'd watch my step if I were you.  After all, you're the only adult in town, and Mother don't like adults.
{E} 'Watch my step'?  I've had enough of you and your little threats, kid -
Whoa!  Calm down, mister.  I was just tellin' ya to be careful, that's all.
{N} Why are all you kids here in the cemetery?
Cause we like it here.  The other little kids are too chicken to play here!
{N} Why?  What do you play?
They play kid games like tic-tac-toe.  We play hide-and-go-seek!  And we're the best!  Heck, we even have a prize you can win!
{N} What makes you think you're the best?
Because we have a secret weapon!
{N} Really?  What is it?
If I told you, then it wouldn't be a secret!
{N} A prize for winning, huh?  What is it?
The keys to the town store!  There's lots of cool stuff inside!  Our fort . . . our candy . . . everything!
{N} Um, it's been a while since I played this game.  Could you tell me the rules?
Yeah.  It's so simple, even you can play!  You cover your eyes and count to ten.  We'll all go hide, and then you try to find us!  If you find any of us, we go back to base, the angel at the center of town.  If you can find all of us, you get the key!
{N} Well that sounds pretty easy.
Hah!  You say that now, but just wait until you try to find us!
{N} Can I play a game of hide-and-seek with you?
Yeah, if you really want to show everyone what a big, fat loser you are!
{E} That's it, big mouth.  You'd better pray that I don't find you.  Let's go!
{N} Hah!  That wasn't so tough.  I found everyone and won fair and square.  Now give me the key to the store.
Hmph!  You big dolt!  You forgot about our secret weapon!
{E} I should have known you would cheat!  What kind of crap are you trying to pull?
Hey, don't get upset, mister.  I told you the rules, I told you about the secret weapon, and you didn't win.
{E} What are you talking about?  I found all of you!
Heh heh heh!  You didn't find all of us!
{E} What?!
You didn't find Carol!  She's our secret weapon!   Heh heh heh heh.  She's the best there is at this game!  She's been hidin' a looooonnngg time.
{E} All right, you twisted little freak.  I dug up your 'secret weapon'.  Satisfied?  Now hand over the keys.
Aww, man!  You suck!  Here's your damn key!
{E} Thanks, Dennis.
{N} I saw the pumpkin patch.  Why is there a lock on the gate?
Oh, that's a great place!  Mother had to put a lock on the gate just to keep us kids out, we like it so much!
{N} Do you happen to know the combination?
No.  Too bad, 'cause all the kids love it in there!
{E} That pumpkin patch is dangerous!  I thought you said that the kids loved it in there!
Hah!  What a sap!  You're a bigger dope than my little brother!
{E} Ha ha ha!  Your little joke almost killed me, you deranged little mutant.
{E} I know about Mother.  I've seen her - she's not human!  Don't you understand what she -
Mother is good.  Mother is the way.  She protects us from the meat who would harm us.  The meat must be killed so that the seedlings can grow.  We're all Mother's seedlings.
{E} Seedlings?!  But you're a child . . . a human child -
Shut up, mister!  I know what she's doing, and I don't care!  Mother was right, she said you adults would try to ruin things!  I don't wanna talk to you anymore, so you just leave me alone or I'll shoot ya with my slingshot!
{H} Hello, young lady.  What's your name?
Eileen Daily.  What's yours?
{N} I . . . I can't remember my name.
Oh . . . well, I'm sorry, but I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
{N} My name is Max.
That's a nice name.
{N} Your name's Eileen, right?
Mm-hm.  Did you forget already?
{N} Where are we?  What town is this?
Don't you know?  This is the pumpkin capital of the state.
{N} I haven't seen any adults in this town.  Where are your parents?  Where are all of the adults?
They just sort of, well, they just went away.
{N} Away to where?  They left you kids all alone?
Oh, we're not alone!  Mother is here to take care of us!
{H} Where is your mother?  I'd really like to talk to her.
Gee, I'm sorry mister Max, but we're not supposed to tell no one.
{N} Why not?
Cause Mother doesn't want to be disturbed while she's resting.
{N} Why are all you kids here in the cemetery?
Our leader Dennis likes to play hide-and-go-seek here.
{N} Can I play a game of hide-and-seek with you?
You'd have to ask Dennis, but I'd rather not play right now.  I was just going to plant my pretty pumpkins.
{H} You like pumpkins, huh?
Mm-hmm.  I like the pretty orange color.
{N} Orange, huh?  That reminds me of a story that Billy told me.
Oh yuck!  Did he tell you that awful cat story?
{N} That's gross, huh?
Yeah!  Just like Billy!
{H} Looks like you finally got to plant your seeds, huh?
Yeah, it was worth bein' found.
{N} Have you finished planting, yet?
Nope.  I have to be careful, so I'm taking my time to do it right.  I want these to grow up nice and big, just like the ones in the pumpkin patch!
Hey!  I'm using that, mister!
{N} Oh, I'm sorry.
That's OK.  You can have it when I'm done.
{N} Looks like you're all done planting your seeds.  Can I borrow your shovel now?
Go ahead!  I'm all done!  Mother will be so proud of me when she wakes up!
{N} Dennis said that Carol is the secret weapon in this game.  Who is she?
Hee hee!  She's our best player, mister!
{N} Well, where is she?
Gee whiz, I can't tell you that!  Then she wouldn't be our secret weapon!
{N} I saw the pumpkin patch.  Why is there a lock on the gate?
I dunno.  Mother says we gotta stay out of the patch.
{N} Do you happen to know the combination?
No . . . I wish I did, though.  I'd love to see all those big, orange pumpkins!  It must be the prettiest place in town!
{E} I know about Mother.  I've seen her - she's not human!  Don't you understand what she -
Mother is good.  Mother is the way.  Mother protects us from the meat who would harm us.  The meat must be killed so that the seedlings can grow.  We are all Mother's seedlings.
{E} Seedlings?!  But you're a child . . . a human child -
But Max, look at my legs.  They're ugly!  I don't want 'em anymore.
{E} But you -
I want to be as pretty as a pumpkin.   That's what daddy used to call me.  His little Pumpkin.
{N} Do you play tic-tac-toe with Jessie?
Yeah.  She thinks she's the best.  But I beat her seven times!
{N} Hi there.  What's your name, kid?
My name's Marcus . . . Marcus Williams.  What's yours?
{N} I . . . I can't remember my name.
That's too bad.  I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
{N} My name is Max.
Hi Max.  I guess you're not a stranger anymore.
{N} Your name's Marcus, right?
Uh-huh.
{N} Where are we?  What town is this?
That's funny.  Didn't you see the sign?
{N} I haven't seen any adults in this town.  Where are your parents?  Where are all of the adults?
Mother made 'em go away.
{N} Away to where?
Sorry, mister, but I'm not allowed to tell you!
{N} Where is your mother?  I'd really like to talk to her.
She's takin' a nap right now.
{N} Why are all you kids here in the cemetery?
Cause Dennis likes it here.
{N} Dennis said that Carol is the secret weapon in this game.  Who is she?
She was my best friend.
{N} Well, where is she?
I don't know.  She went away right about the same time as all the adults.  I miss her a lot.  We used to float boats together.
{N} I'm sorry to hear that she went away.  But why does Dennis call her his secret weapon?
I don't know.  Maybe she's hiding somewhere.  Dennis won't tell the rest of us.  He just says if anyone tries to win at hide-and-seek, they hafta find Carol.
{N} I bet he doesn't know where she is, either.
Yeah!  He's tricky like that!
{N} Do you happen to know the combination?
Nope!
{E} I know about Mother.  I've seen her - she's not human!  Don't you understand what she -
Mother is good.  Mother is the way.  She protects us from the meat who would harm us.  The meat must be killed so that the seedlings can grow.  We're all Mother's seedlings.
{S} Meat?!  That's horrible!
Mother says I can be a lily pad and float down the creek, just like my boats.
{S} No, Marcus!  I understand that you want to -
You don't understand!  Mother was right!  You just want to ruin everything!  Go away!
{N} Hi there.  What's your name, kid?
Derek.  What's yours?
{N} I . . . I can't remember my name.
Uh-oh!  You'd better go away!  I'm not supposed to talk to strangers!
{N} My name is Max.
Hi Max.  I'm Derek.
Yes, I know.
{N} Your name's Derek, right?
Uh-huh.
{N} Where are we?  What town is this?
Ummm . . . I dunno.
{N} I haven't seen any adults in this town.  Where are your parents?  Where are all of the adults?
I dunno.
{N} Why are all you kids here in the cemetery?
Cause Dennis says so.
{N} Dennis said that Carol is the secret weapon in this game.  Who is she?
She's my brother's best friend.  He always played with that stupid girl instead of me.
{N} Well, where is she?
I dunno.
{N} I saw the pumpkin patch.  Why is there a lock on the gate?
That's where all the pumpkins are!
{E} I know that!  Why is it locked?
I dunno.
{E} That pumpkin patch is dangerous!  Those birds almost gouged my eyes out!  They . . . they could have killed me!
Really?  I'm never goin' in there!
{E} I know about Mother.  I've seen her - she's not human!  Don't you understand what she -
Mother's good.  Mother's the way.  She protects us from the meat who'd harm us.  The meat must be killed so that the seedlings can grow.  We're all Mother's seedlings.
{S} Seedlings?!  But you're a child . . . a human child -
Mother's gonna let me be a sugar cane!  I'll be the yummiest of everyone!
{S} But Derek, you -
No!  You're a bad man!  You're gonna ruin everything!  Leave me alone!
{N} Hi there.  What's your name, kid?
My name is Timothy.  Timothy O'Toole . . . but you can call me Timmy.  All the other kids call me Timmy.  What's your name, mister?
{N} I . . . I can't remember my name.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  I'd like to talk with you, but I'm not supposed to speak with strangers.
{N} My name is Max.
That's a good name.  Now you're not a stranger.
{N} Your name's Timmy, right?
That's right.
{N} Where are we?  What town is this?
The name of the town is on a big sign.  Didn't you see it?  Where are you from?
{N} I . . . don't remember.
Well, you remembered your name.  Maybe you'll remember where you came from next.
{N} I haven't seen any adults in this town.  Where are your parents?  Where are all of the adults?
Mother said that God made them all go away, 'cause we're his special children.
{N} Special children?  What does your mother mean by that?
Mother said that God wanted her to protect His special children, so he sent her to save us.
{N} Save you from what?
From the disease, of course.
{N} Disease?
Mm-hm, the disease of meat.
{N} Meat?  Is she a vegetarian?
What's a vegiteareeyon?
{N} It's someone who eats plants, not animals.
Well, I think that's what she is.
{N} How are the fish biting today?
Not so good . . . but I could sit here all day, so I don't care.
{N} You mean you never go into town?
Well, only to go to church.  But I haven't heard the call to mass in a long time.
{N} The call to mass?  What's that?
Father would ring the bell.  But since all the adults went away, no one's been able to ring it.
{N} Really?  How come?
Dennis cut the rope, so no one can reach it.
{N} I've read some newspapers and they mention a Reverend O'Toole.  Is he a relative of yours?
Yes.  He's my father.
{N} I'd like to speak with your father.  Is he close by?
Sort of, but Mother said never speak about it.
{N} Why?
I'm sorry, I just can't talk about it or I'll get in trouble.
{N} What kind of trouble?
I'll be punished like Maria was!  I don't wanna go to the patch!
{N} Punished?  You mean in that pumpkin patch on the other side of town?
Yes!  Can we talk about something else?  I'm getting scared.
Okay, okay.  I didn't mean to upset you.
{N} Isn't Dennis your brother?
Yes, but I don't like him.  He's mean to me!
{N} Mean?  How is he mean to you?
He won't let me play hide-and-go-seek with him and his friends.  He says I'm just a stupid little kid.
{N} Dennis said that Carol is the secret weapon in this game.  Who is she?
I don't know.  I haven't seen Carol for a long time.  But you never know with my rotten brother.  He's always trying to trick someone.  That's why I never play with him.  I'd rather be fishin'.
{N} I saw the pumpkin patch.  Why is there a lock on the gate?
That's a bad, bad place!  I'd stay away from it if I were you!
{E} That pumpkin patch is dangerous!  Those birds almost gouged my eyes out!  They . . . they could have killed me!
That's why I'm never going in there!  I'll stay out here where it's safe.
{E} I know about Mother.  I've seen her - she's not human!  Don't you understand what she -
Mother is good.  Mother is the way.  She protects us all from the meat who'd harm us.  The meat must be destroyed so that the seedlings can grow.  We're all Mother's seedlings.
{S} Seedlings?!  But you're a child . . . a human child -
Don't be silly.  Mother's going to make us better, like God told her to.
{E} Better?  But how?!
She's going to let me be a lily pad, like Marcus.  That way I can be with the fish.
{S} My God!  That's horrible!
Oh, you're no fun at all!  Go away!
So, you've finally arrived.  I suppose it was inevitable.  Yet, I'd hoped that the pumpkin patch would deter your progress.  Apparently not. I must admit that I'm intrigued as to how you arrived here.  I was certain I'd weeded out your kind before sleep overtook me.  Meat secretions hang in the air around your body, they offend my senses.
{S} My God . . . what are you?
I am beyond your understanding, human.  However, you may call me what the children do . . . Mother.
{E} Mother?!  I should call you what you are, nothing but a disease!
Mind your tongue, human.  I am more parent to these seedlings than you or anyone else could be.
{E} These aren't your seedlings, they're children!  Flesh and blood!  Don't you see that?
I see, and it disgusts me!  Animal sacks filled with loose cells - it's a wonder you don't burst.  What an inferior vessel for the spirits of these children.
{E} But why have you done this?
The children were in danger.
{E} Danger from what?  You've done more harm than -
Than what?  You?  The meat called Jeddah showed me how harmful your kind can be, as did the one called preacher.
{E} Jeddah?  I saw his name on the pumpkin patch sign . . . what does he have to do with all this?
He made me see the evil of your kind, how destructive you are.  Jeddah preyed upon his own child, making her suffer, and die.
The entire town turned a blind eye to Jeddah's crimes, and I watched.  The people's vicious disregard for Carol's safety was no less a crime than her father's!
{E} So you killed them!?
Their own inner chaos would have destroyed them eventually.  I only expedited the event, set things in order.
{N} Why were you so concerned about Carol?
She talked to me when no one would listen.  I tried to communicate with them but . . .  Carol's voice was like music to me.  She was my favorite, and I failed her.
{E} How does the preacher figure into all of this?  What could he possibly have done?
He was a superstitious fool.  He spread paranoia and fear, swaying the others away from rational thought.  The humans put their trust and faith in him, and followed.  When the preacher assured them that Jeddah wasn't a real threat to Carol, they listened.
{E} If you're as omnipotent as you seem to think you are, then why haven't you 'weeded' me out also?
In due time, little meat.  For now you are of little consequence to me.
{E} My name is Max, not meat.
Your name is meaningless.  An animal noise.  And you are nothing more than a bag of meat.
{E} If you truly feel that way, then why have you spared the children?  Aren't they meat, too?
Yes, and you have seen them bickering and divided.  Yet they are not beyond hope.  The children still have some innocence, which, with some reconstructing on the cellular level, I will cultivate in order to give them salvation.
{E} And you think that you can offer them salvation?!  What conceit!!
It is not conceit!  After I complete their transformation, the children will be one with me, forever!  That is their salvation!
{E} You want to make the children 'one with you', but you don't care about them!
I am going to save them.  They will live forever through me.
{E} Transforming them into simple plants? You call that salvation?
Simple Plants'?!  Insolent meat!  You know what your problem is?  You lack structure.  The cells in your body are practically floating away - it makes me sick to look at you.  Everything around you is in chaos.  My form is superior in every way to your weak flesh.
{E} If my flesh is so weak, then why are you afraid of me?
Afraid?!  Of you?!  Hah!  You overestimate yourself!
{E} I think you're the one who overestimates yourself, you perverse, bloated egomaniac!!
You impudent wretch!
Beware, Max.  The closer you come to reaching your goal, the more danger you are in.  Someone seeks to keep you here with us forever . . .  One who will do anything to keep you from leaving the Asylum.
{N} Why?!  Who conspires against me?!
I can only say that if you leave, it will mean this person's downfall . . .  But your time is short, waste not fruitless questions on me.  The air grows thick with frost, and soon I must return to my eternal slumber.
{N} It . . . It's getting co- cold!!
The temperature is dropping . . .  They want you to sleep . . . like me . . . forever . . .
{N} Fo- fo- forever?!
You must escape this cold tomb, for there are other secrets frozen in time.
{N} Who are you?
My name's Arthur . . .  Arthur Patrick . . .  Yes, that's it.
{N} What are you doing in the drawer?
Last . . . last thing I remember, I was taking a nap in the courtyard, and then they were dragging me to some weird laboratory.
{N} On the rooftop?
Hmm . . . could be.  I don't know for sure . . . it was raining . . . smelled blood . . . Dr. Morgan was there.  He looked at me and said I was too damned old for his purposes . . . I . . .  I remember he was holding a human head!  And then . . .  I think I fainted.  They must've thought I was dead.  Next thing I knew I was in that drawer!  And scared all to hell!
{N} Being in that drawer is enough to scare anyone.
Darn right!  Dark and closed in . . . the terrible cold . . . and God, that awful scratching!!
{N} It was a bit chilly in there, wasn't it?
Chilly?  I damn near froze my ass off!!  Started to fall asleep . . . must've dozed off until you came by.  Did you turn up the heat?
{N} Yes, I did.
Well, it's . . . its nice here now.  Thank you, sonny!
{N} Scratching?  What exactly was it?
Can't say for sure . . . just remember hearing these awful screeching and scraping noises nearby.
{N} Nearby where?  Outside?
It's kind of disorienting in there, you know.  Sounded muffled, but . . . I . . . I guess the sound was coming from another drawer.
{N} Morgan?  He was holding a head?!
Swear on a stack of Bibles, I saw it!  His arms were red with blood and he was swinging around the head as he was talking . . . kind of gesturing with it, you know?  He was really yelling at the two orderlies . . . some patient got loose or something . . . I don't know any more than that, because I fainted dead away at that point.
{N} I saw some marks scraped on the inside of drawer number seven, but they didn't seem to say anything.
Now I wonder . . . I remember this one patient had a glass eye, carved all sorts of little lines into things.  Claimed it was the only words he could understand.   I guess they got him, too.
{N} Speak to me tree, lest your eyes nest with birds!
Nnngghh?!  Why have you summoned me, stranger?  Normally it is the man with the glass eye who speaks the words of commandment.
{N} I'm afraid he's dead.  But he left behind the cryptic message that led me to you.
Very well.  What is it that you seek?
{N} Who are you?
My name is Malus Ioensis.  I am the guardian of the light.  Protector of the grove.
{N} How do you guard the light?  It's all around us.
Fool!  The light.  It is housed within the heart of ancient, mighty warriors.  They alone understand the true meaning of sacrifice.
{N} I don't understand.  What do you sacrifice?
Freedom, movement, growth.  My limbs ache to stretch upwards into the nurturing sunlight, yet I must remain steadfast, lest my trunk stray from its position in the grove.  I am he who must remain in place.
{N} Why must the grove be protected?
Greed, pride, evil, these aspects of humanity threaten all life.  Thus I remain, and none may pass . . . save one.
{N} Who?
The creator.
{N} The creator?
Yes.  By his name only shall I be swayed from my place.
{N} In the name of your creator, Paul Stark, I command you to move aside.
Paul Stark, the creator, he who planted my seed and gave me life.  In his name I do as commanded.
{N} Old woman!  What is your station?
By the great spirits!  You have arrived . . . I thought your arrival to be merely a vision, but here you stand . . . Olmec, the holy warrior!  Praise the Gods!
{N} Still your tongue, old crone.  I asked your station.  What is it?
Forgive me.  My name is Teteo.  I am the village oracle.
{N} Why have you come to greet me, old one?  Where is the village chieftain?
He is repairing the village, great one!  Forgive us, for we are few in number.
{N} What of this village?  Why was I summoned?
It is Quetzalcoatl, holy one!  He has returned!
{N} What nonsense is this?  He sits on his majestic throne in the heavens, not in this pathetic dung heap of a village!
N- n- no, sacred one!  He truly has returned, just as prophesied on the Wall of Sorrow!
{N} What story does this Wall tell?
Oh, if it suits you, your holiness, please allow me to read you the tale of our village, as has been passed down over generations.
{N} If you speak the truth, then I must see him.  Where is he?
He stands atop the angry mountain, your grandness.  He is using his magic to bring forth the blood of the land to kill us all!
{N} The Jaguar Temple still stands?
Yes.  It withstood both the flood and the rock slides.  He intends to melt the very stones of the temple itself with the blood of the angry mountain . . . destroying what's left of the village.
{N} Your tale told of the Shaven head Otonmi warriors.  Where are they?
Quetzalcoatl slaughtered them as if they were children . . . and now their shades roam the land, trapped here by his wicked magic.
{N} Shades, eh?  Can they not fight still, in these new forms?
Nay, fearless one, they are but lost souls, trapped between life and death.  Their inability to battle their foe has driven them mad.  They rant only crazed things in the voices of ghosts.
{E} Quetzalcoatl!  Why have you returned to this place?
Olmec!  I should have known you'd come.  You follow your god's commands like the dog that you are!  Go back down to your followers and wait for your death as they do.  You are powerless against me here.
{E} You dare speak to me in such a tone?!  I have enough power to handle the likes of you!!
Hah!  Empty threats from a cowardly warrior!
{N} Why do you seek to destroy those that worshipped you?  You were their greatest king!
Bah!  They are loyal to none but themselves!  Soon after my death they stopped offering sacrifice, and now they will pay with their lives!
{N} Why have you left your heavenly throne?  For a god to return to this land is a disgrace!
I am more than a god . . . I am a warrior!!  That idle throne is an empty chair that threatens to devour my eternal soul!  I will conquer this world one village at a time, until all are destroyed!
{N} And then what?  When there is nothing left to conquer, what will you do?
I grow with the power of the souls I consume!  When this world has been stripped of all its souls, I will be the most powerful god of all!!  I will conquer the heavens!! Hahahaha!
Hahahaha!  You fool!!  You cannot touch me!  In death I have gained much power!  The souls of the Shaven head Otonmi feed my magic!!
{N} Old man!  What say you?
I say that the end is near!  Quetzalcoatl will destroy us all, lest I find one who can bring me the Pod of Might.
{N} What name do you go by, ancient one?
My name is Tezacatl . . . I am the village's last hope!  It is my duty as village witch to destroy this devil who plagues us!
{N} What is this pod you speak of?
The sacred Pod of Might.  It contains the seeds I require to finish my spell, yet there is no way to reach it!
{N} Why is that?
It clings to the Joining Tree . . . surrounded by liquid fire!  Not even your stone form could withstand its heat!
{N} How does the tree survive if it is surrounded by fire?
It is magic, as is the Pod that grows on it's mighty trunk.  However, the magic is fading and the limbs will soon wither and burn.
{E} There must be some way to reach it!
Perhaps  . . . the ancient Rite of the Warrior may be the answer.
{N} Rite of the Warrior?  What will that old magic accomplish?
It is old indeed, wise one.  Though not practiced for many generations, it is rumored to have the ability to make a warrior impervious to the elements.
{N} Then I will go through the trials.  Perform it.
F- forgive me, sacred one, I cannot.  I don't remember the complete ceremony.  However, the stone mason knows it.  He is the village chief now and is over at the huts.
{N} Why is a lowly mason your chief?
The others are all dead!  Besides myself, he is the only male left in our village.
{N} Why do you sit here, idle in the village, instead of fighting?  What kind of coward are you!?
Harsh words, your holiness.  But I am not merely sitting here!  I am meditating . . . to gain the power needed to combat his awful magic.
{N} How do you expect to defeat a god, little man?
I don't.  He is very strong . . . I cannot possibly hope to defeat him.  However, if I anger him enough with my spell, he will spend precious energy on me.  That should sufficiently weaken him enough for you to defeat him.
{N} You would sacrifice yourself for the village?
It must be done.
{N} What spell are you preparing?
It is called the Spirit Fire.  It creates a mystic energy wave formed by the souls of the dead.
{N} I see the temples are nearly destroyed by Quetzalcoatl's dark magic.
Yes.  The totems may be in grave danger.
{N} What totems are you speaking of?
The statues sheltered within the temples.  These statues represent the purity of the gods themselves.  I believe Quetzalcoatl fears them, else why would he seek to destroy them?
{N} Your wife mourns for you, witch.
She knows what I plan, and fears the future without me.  She has seen our two warrior sons die at the hands of Quetzalcoatl and soon she will bury me.
{N} I have undergone the Rite of the Warrior.  Where is the Joining Tree, from which the Pod of Might Hangs?
It is north of here, near the base of the volcano.
{N} I have the Pod of Might, old one.  Here . . . . . . work your magic.
Very good.  Thank you, sacred one.  I will begin at once.
{N} Although honorable in your sacrifice, the village is still in danger, old one.  Quetzalcoatl has powerful magic at his disposal.
Ma . . . ma . . . m . . . mask.
{N} Mask?  What mask do you speak of?
D . . . death mask  his power . . . c . . . comes from it
{E} Where is it?!
B . . . below . . . the maze . . .
{N} You there!  What is your station?
Hmph . . . I was the stone mason.  Now I am the village chief.  What are you?!  And why do you enter this village?
{E} I am Olmec!  Holy warrior!  You dare address me in that tone?!
I do!  You may frighten the others, but you'll get no such satisfaction from me!  Where were you when we needed you most?!  Your arrival now means nothing to me . . . you're too late!
{E} You say I am late, but you are wrong!
Is that so?!  My precious daughter lies crushed beneath these rocks!!  The day Quetzalcoatl arrived I prayed to your god with all my heart, and you come to us now?!  The warriors are dead!  The temples are in ruins!  My daughter is dead!
{N} You say your daughter is dead?  How do you know?
She was in her hut when the rocks fell!  Look around you!  Death is everywhere!  I have lost everything that is dear to me!
{N} You say you were the stone mason?
Yes.  That is my trade.  Like my father before me and his father before him, I work with the earth, shaping it to my will.  I am a simple craftsman who now rules what's left of the village.  A heavy burden on my weary shoulders.
{N} There are worse fates, mason.
I know.  I have seen what happens to those who oppose Quetzalcoatl's rule.
{N} His punishment is swift and severe, in death as it was in life, when he ruled this village as king.
Yes, but he was just and true back then!  Not this abomination which has returned to destroy us!  We revered him when he was of flesh and bone . . . and upon his death, we crafted a tomb as a monument to his greatness!  I myself crafted the stones and jewelry he was adorned with!
{N} The witch spoke of the Rite of the Warrior.  He said you know the ceremony.  Perform it on me . . . now.
Why should I help you?!  You have done nothing to help me!  My daughter lies cold and broken beneath a pile of rubble!  Hmph!  If you are as powerful as you say, then bring my daughter back from the land of the dead!  If you could do that, then I would have reason to help you in your quest.
{N} Mason!  I would have a word with you!  I have spoken with the spirit of Tepictoc, warrior, and husband to Chalchihut.
The fisherman?  His spirit remains here?
{N} Yes.  You have the necklace that belongs to his wife.  Give it to her, or I will shatter your limbs like twigs!!
Very well.  Tell your spirit that I will deliver his gift.
Coatlicue!  My daughter!  You have returned from death!
{N} Fool!  She was trapped within the temple!  Had you not been so stubborn and full of self-pity you would have realized that!
Oh, my precious daughter!  I am so sorry!!   Go see your mother, she misses you terribly
{N} I have found your daughter, mason.  It is time for me to undergo the Rite of the Warrior.
You are truly honorable, Olmec.  Please find it in your heart to forgive me.  I should never have doubted you -
{E} Enough groveling, chieftain!  Get on with it!!
Y- yes . . . of course!  There are two stages to the ritual.  The first is an act of bravery and heroism.  You've already shown that by returning my daughter to me.  Second, you must recite the names of the warriors who have come before you in order of their lineage.
{N} I'd like to undergo the second stage of the ritual.
Do you know all six names of the warriors who came before you?
{N} No . . . not yet.
I'm sorry, you must find all six before I test you.
{N} Yes, I do.
Then let us begin, Olmec.  Name the six warriors, starting with the youngest and ending with the eldest.
{N} Tepictoc.
{N} Centeotl.
{N} Huitzilop.
{N} Mixcoatl.
{N} Ometoch.
{N} Xilonen.
I am sorry, oh brave Olmec.  But that is incorrect.  Review their lineage, and I will test you again.
You are most wise, grand Olmec.  You are now ready for the ancient magics of the land, handed down to me by my father, and his father before him.  To protect you from the mighty elements, I must combine your stone flesh with my blood and the magics of the earth.  This will create a temporary magical barrier between yourself and the forces of nature.
{N} How long will it last?
Not long.  You must be swift in your quest.
{N} Mason, your daughter spoke of a mask you created for Quetzalcoatl.
The death mask?  Yes.  It is ceremonial, and tradition for such a mask to adorn the face of a dead king.
{N} Your child also said that it was magical.
Yes, the witch and I performed the archaic spell of spiritual strength upon it.  We thought it would ensure a speedy journey to the afterlife for our respected king.
{E} Are you mad?!  That spell was forbidden by the elders!  It grants a destructive force which can corrupt even the noblest of souls!!  He must be using the mask for his power!  Where is it?!  It must be destroyed!!
It is sealed in his tomb!  There is no way to get to it!
{E} I must find a way to open the seal!  Where is your father?
He was sacrificed during the burial ceremony of Quetzalcoatl, so that none would learn the secret of the seal!
{N} Woman!  What say you?
Olmec?  You have come to us?  Thank the gods, for our prayers have been answered!
{N} Yes, your prayers reached me and I am here.  What is your station?
I am the wife of the chieftain.
{N} Why was your husband spared Quetzalcoatl's wrath?
He was praying inside the Temple of the Jaguar when the evil one came.  By the time the echoes of death reached him, the battle was over.  He emerged to find nearly the entire village destroyed.  He was bound by tradition to become chieftain.  Thus he cannot attack Quetzalcoatl, and now he broods in a dark mood.  He sees himself a coward for not being able to die in battle with the others.
{N} What happened during the battle?
At first, when we saw our revered king back from the land of the dead, we were overjoyed.  We thought he had come back to lead us to great victories.  Instead, he came to destroy us.  Although our warriors fought fiercely, Quetzalcoatl scattered them like broken twigs.  After they had been killed, he unleashed his dark magic on us.
{N} What magics did he wield?
He caused a massive wave to come down and crush the Temple of Water.  He caused the earth to shake violently, the mountain broke apart and almost crushed all the huts, burying the Temple of Wind.  Only the Temple of the Jaguar withstood his power.
{E} You speak of tradition as though it is undesirable.  Your husband should be honored to be chieftain!
But Olmec, oh wise one, it was never his desire to become chieftain - especially not this way!  Working with the earth and revealing the secrets it hid inside brought him great joy.
{N} Who remains in the village?
There are but a handful of us left.  My husband does what he can to repair the damage to the walls of the huts, but his mind is elsewhere.  The death of our beloved daughter weighs heavily upon him.
{N} She was killed in the battle?
My husband insists that she was crushed beneath the boulders which destroyed the village walls.
{N} You speak as though you disbelieve your own words.
I cannot help myself.  I somehow feel that she still lives.
{N} I have found your daughter, woman.
Oh, thank you, Olmec!  You have brought hope back into the lives of myself and my husband.  As long as we have hope, the future will remain as bright as the sun!!
{N} Child, why were you in the temple?
The shiny rock . . . it's pretty.  And I like the music, too.
{N} Shiny rock?
Yes, it's a big crystal . . . like the ones father makes into jewelry.  He made a scary mask before, and a necklace, and a lot of rings!!
{N} You mentioned a mask your father had created.  The witch also spoke of a mask.  He called it a 'death mask'.  Are these the same?
Oh yes!  That's what father called it.  It was for King Quetzalcoatl, after he died.  Father said it was magic!
{N} What kind of magic, child?
I don't know.  Ask father.  He knows.
{N} What music do you speak of, little one?
The gongs.  Sometimes I can get a few of them to make the same sound.  It's fun!
{N} Woman!  What say you?  Why do you weep so?
Forgive me, oh holy one, for not showing you the proper respect, but I am wracked with grief over the loss of my husband.  He died in the battle with Quetzalcoatl.
{N} Who was your husband?
His name was Tepictoc.  He was a warrior, but also the village's best fisherman.  He lived off the gifts of the sea, and devoutly worshipped the Goddess of Water.  The cool walls of the Water Temple were to his liking, and he often spent his days in deep meditation and prayer there.
{N} I have seen that the Water Temple is flooded.
Yes, by the evil one's doing.  Quetzalcoatl called down a wave of water to destroy it, but it still stands proudly in the water.
{N} Widow, you say your husband was quite familiar with the Water Temple.  I have seen strange carvings on the temple walls that I do not understand.  Can you explain them?
No, I am sorry, great one.  I am ignorant of such things.  If my husband were alive  he would be able to help you out.
{N} Sad one, I have spoken with the spirit of your husband.
Is he well?
{N} The spirits are not as you and I.  They speak in broken words and thoughts.  When I asked of the carvings of the temple, he repeated the word 'creed' to me.  Do you know what this word means?
He lived by the fisherman's creed.  He would often chant it to himself during prayer.  The words are as follows:  'When God's eye is high above, spear the water quickly, for if the fish lie unaware, your baskets will be filled with the warrior's bounty.'
{N} Repeat the fisherman's creed to me.
Yes, holy one.  It is this:  'When God's eye is high above, spear the water quickly, for if the fish lie unaware, your baskets will be filled with the warrior's bounty.'
{N} The jewelry suits you well, widow.
Thank you, Olmec.  You have brought much happiness to my sad heart.  Every time I see its reflection in the waters I will think of my husband, and of you for granting me this inner peace.
That looks like a red herring.  I appreciate the gift, but I haven't much use for it.  When my husband found them in his nets, he would curse his luck.  He claimed they are useless things that simply take up space.
{N} Old woman!  What say you?
Mmmph . . . I see the Oracle was successful in summoning you.  Although at this point, I don't see much use in it.  The damage has been done.  You have no purpose here.
{E} What do you mean by that, bitter crone?!  I am Olmec!  I fight for the gods themselves!
You sound as zealous as my husband . . . the fool.
{N} What man would be mad enough to wed your sour tongue, old one?
Hah!  Tezacatl, the witch, is my husband!  He fathered two fine warriors with me, and now he runs to meet death's embrace!  Meanwhile I must sit by obediently while he throws away his life on a fool's errand.
{N} What errand do you speak of?
He plans on fighting that bastard undead king using his small magic!  He is doomed . . . and will die in vain!
{N} Where are your two sons?  Did they die in battle?
Yes . . . Quetzalcoatl shattered their bodies as though they were made of straw.  Soon my fool husband will join them . . . and I'll be truly alone.
{N} What is that you are mixing?
Nothing important, holy one.  Just a simple balm for my aching bones.  Age has not been kind to me.
{N} Your husband is a brave man, old one.  He faces Quetzalcoatl to help the good of the village.  He knows he will not survive the battle.
And what of me?  I need his protection more than the rest of the village!  He should be here for me!
{E} Still your selfish tongue, crone!!  He does what is required.  He faces death as a brave warrior should!!
You are as much a fool as him.
{N} Loneliness destroyed her resolve.  She drank of a liquid most foul and now seeks those that went before her.  May the gods have mercy on her soul.
{N} Spirit!  What say you?
Guard . . . totem . . . honor demands . . . to stay true.
{N} Why do you stand here, fallen one?  What does this totem mean to you?
Stand where I fall . . . Temple of Wind . . . protect . . . even in death.
{N} I mean no harm to the temple.  I am Olmec, holy warrior.
Lies . . . and deceptions . . . like the evil one! . . .  None may pass . . . all seek . . . to destroy.
{N} You are confused, lost warrior.  I speak the truth.  Quetzalcoatl is my enemy as well.  Step aside, so that I may visit the temple.
Prove . . . prove words . . . true . . .  Act of faith . . . perform a test . . . before I grant . . . passage.
{N} I accept your challenge, shade.  What will be this test of faith?
Gift . . . never given . . . wife . . .
{N} A gift for your wife?  Of what kind?
Glimmers . . . circles . . . neck . . .
{N} A necklace?  Simple enough, I will find one for her and -
No!!  Special . . . is . . . this . . . crafted . . . for her . . . maker kept it . . . prove . . . words . . . be true . . .
{N} What name did you go by in this world, fallen hero?
Tepictoc . . . hunt the waters . . . bounty of . . . the seas . . .
{N} A fisherman?
Yes . . . and warrior . . . and husband . . .
{N} Who was your wife?
She . . . who has my . . . heart . . .
{E} I meant her name!  What is her name?!
Reveal . . . not . . . harm her . . . you will . . .
{N} What  was your station as a warrior, spirit?
Young . . . I was . . . but older . . . than Ometoch.
{N} I have spoken with the mason, dead one.  He will deliver the gift as promised.
Honorable . . . Olmec . . . truth . . . in your breath . . . I am . . . grateful . . . . . . temple . . . awaits you . . . winds . . .
{N} As a fisherman, you must be familiar with the water temple.  What do you know of the carvings that mark the inner wall?
Sacred place . . . devout . . . may pass . . . to pray . . . within the cool walls . . . speak creed . . . live . . . creed . . .
{N} What creed?
The creed . . . life . . . water . . . creed . . .
{E} What?!  You babble, shade!!
Creed . . . the creed . . .
{N} Spirit!  What say you?
Bitter . . . defeat . . . cursed to roam . . .
{N} What name did you go by in this world, fallen hero?
Centeotl . . . fierce warrior . . . clan . . Shaven Head Otonmi . . .
{N} The Shaven Head Otonmi?
Yes . . . savage . . . destroyers . . .
{N} What was your station as warrior, spirit?
In . . . my prime . . . older than Tepictoc . . . younger . . . than Huitzilop . . .
{N} Why do you roam this land still, fallen one?
Evil one . . . feeds . . . off our . . . spiritual energy . . . gone forever . . . are we soon . . . never to . . . join . . . our elders . . . in the hall . . . of the . . . dead . . .
{N} Spirit!  What say you?

{N} What name did you go by in this world, fallen hero?
Huitzilop . . . bearer of war . . . son of Tezacatl . . . village . . . witch . . .
{N} You are the son of Tezacatl?
Yes . . . wise . . . elder . . .
{N} What was your station as warrior, spirit?
Veteran . . . of many battles . . . younger brother . . . of Mixcoatl . . .
{N} Why do you hang your head in shame, brave one?
Could not defeat . . . one warrior . . . all our clan . . . failed . . . to stop just . . . one man . . .

Failed . . . all . . . could not defeat . . . one . . .

{N} Do you judge yourself a failure?  How can that be, when you have died in honor on the battlefield?

{N} Fear not young warrior, the village is not doomed as long as I draw breath.
So thought . . . our clan . . . quick to battle . . . did we run . . . quick . . . to die . . .

Cannot . . . the dishonor . . . for dying in . . . first . . . battle . . . curse me . . . for eternity . . .
{N} Where am I?
You've been here before, don't you remember?
{N} No.  This place isn't familiar at all.
It's the courtyard, Max.  You like it here.
{N} Excuse me, what's your name?
Jeez, Max.  It's the same as it was yesterday, and the day before that.  I'm Bruce.  Bruce Chambers . . . remember?  Man, that wreck musta really rattled your brain!
{N} A car wreck?
Yeah.  Takin' that nurse's car for a joyride wasn't the brightest thing you ever done.  I mean, now your face is all messed up and you can't remember squat.
{E} I'm not crazy!  I shouldn't be here!
Now just calm down, Max.  Calm down.
{N} But I'm not crazy . . .
Sure you're not, Max.  Sure.
{N} Where is that awful music coming from?
Oh, the observation room.  Dr. Morgan said that he was doing some auditory experiments . . . whatever that means.
{E} I know this will sound nuts, but I was just in this weird little town where a huge alien plant killed all the adults, but not the kids.
You're right.
{N} You . . . you mean you believe me?
No.  I mean it sounds nuts.  Just take your pill, Max, and you'll feel better.
{N} Where am I?
Where do you think?!  The Asylum, you nut job.
{N} Excuse me, what's your name?
Why do you damn loons always gotta talk so damn much?!  Christ!  My name's Hector!  Hector Vasquez!  Now get the hell away from me, you look like a god-damned mummy!
{N} Why is my head all wrapped up like this?
Cause you're so freakin' ugly, I guess!   Heh heh heh!  OK, Mummy Man.  I'll be straight with you.  You see, when the little green men came to -
{E} Ah, forget it you jerk.
{E} I'm not crazy!  I shouldn't be here!
Hey!  Don't blow a head pipe, psycho!  That act won't get you anywhere with me!
{N} Where is that awful music coming from?
You mean you don't see the orchestra full of pink elephants?
{N} Very funny.
Hmph!  I guess you lost your sense of humor when you lost your marbles!
{E} I know this will sound nuts, but I was just in this weird little town where a huge alien plant killed all the adults, but not the kids.
Good for you.  Why don't you go back there?
{N} Where am I?
Da courtyard.
{N} Excuse me, what's your name?
Stan Dumbrowski.  Don't forget it!
{E} I'm not crazy!  I shouldn't be here!
Shaddup before I pound ya one.
{N} Where is that awful music coming from?
Doc's doin' some kind of test in da observation room.
{N} Oh.  What kind of test?
How should I know, maggot?
{E} I know this will sound nuts, but I was just in this weird little town where a huge alien plant killed all the adults, but not the kids.
Ah, shuddup!
{N} Where am I?
The Asylum, of course.  In the courtyard.  We had to evacuate the tower cells, because of the explosion.
{N} What explosion?
The generator.  It was supposed to be repaired this week.  I guess they were a little too late.
{N} Oh.  What about all the patients up there?
I'm afraid you were the only one who survived, my friend.
{S} I'm the only survivor?!  My God!  How many people died up there?
I'd say 15 or so.  The fire spread quickly after the second explosion.  Then there was no way to reach them in time, but, how did you manage to escape?
{N} If I told you, you'd think I'm really insane.
Try me.  I'd like to know how you survived this disaster.
{N} Excuse me, what's your name?
John Whitefoot, Max.  Don't you remember?
{N} No.  I'm sorry.
{E} I'm not crazy!  I shouldn't be here!
That's a familiar story around here, my friend.
{N} Where is that awful music coming from?
Doctor Morgan is testing a few theories on how music affects the patients.  He's conducting his research in the observation room.
{E} I know this will sound nuts, but I was just in this weird little town where a huge alien plant killed all the adults, but not the kids.
I see.
{N} Ah, you must think I'm as loony as the others.
No, that's not true.  I have my own theory on what could have happened to you.
{N} What's your theory?
Well, I think that maybe your mind couldn't handle the thought of you abandoning those who needed help.  So you constructed a world to hide in, inside your mind, until it was safe to come back.  The town represented the tower, the children were the patients, and the missing adults represented the doctors and other authority figures who weren't around to help.
{N} Huh.  Maybe you're right . . . but it all seemed so real.
Your mind is capable of wondrous things, Max.  In your head, it was real.
{N} Excuse me, what's your name?
Doctor?  Are you my doctor?
Doctor?  Are you all right?
{N}  I am a doctor!   I'm okay.  Thank you.  Yes, I am a doctor, but I don't work here.
Oh.  I was hoping you were a new doctor.  Since my friend stopped talking to me I've been so lonely.  I need someone to cure him so he could talk to me again.
{N} Who is your friend?
Crag.
{N} What's wrong with him?  Does he have laryngitis?
I . . . I don't know . . . maybe.  All I know is that he hasn't visited or talked to me in a while.
{N} Has Crag gone away?  Maybe he was released from the Asylum and didn't tell you.
No.  He wasn't a patient here.  He just used to visit me by the fountain on sunny days.
{N} Why are you so lonely?  I mean, there are other people here to talk to.
I don't like them.  They're all crazy.  Crag was different.  He was tall, dark, and handsome.   He thought I was pretty.
{N} I'll bet you are pretty, under that heavy hood.  Why do you hide your face?
Since Crag stopped visiting me, I don't want to show my ugly face to anyone.
{N} Stop talking like that!  You're not ugly!
You're just being polite.  You don't fool me.
{N} Where is that awful music coming from?
Oh!  You can hear it, too?  Thank goodness!  I thought I was imagining it!  Where is it coming from?
{N} Um . . . I don't know.
{N} Where do these big doors lead?  It sounds like someone's inside.
Preacher Bob is giving a sermon inside.  I wanted to go in to the chapel myself, but the doors are stuck.  I can't budge them.
{N} How did the preacher get inside if the chapel doors are stuck?
He must've had help from his little lackey, Norm.
{N} Can you tell me anything about the other patients?
Not really.  They're all crazy!  I avoid them whenever I can.
{N} I fixed your fountain.  Has your friend returned?
Oh yes!!  I'm so happy!  Crag has returned!  Can't you see him?  Isn't he glorious?
{N} Excuse me, what's your name?
My name?   Disciple Norman!  This lost sheep seeks the truth!
Seek the truth, preacher!
Amen, Norman!   I go by many names, my child, but you may call me Preacher Bob.
{N} You seem to be quite . . . well . . . energetic about the topic of stealing.  Why is that?
Oh, the wicked are among us, my friend!  They spread their vile ideas and sinful thoughts like a cancer!  And now, the sinners have desecrated the sanctity of His house!
{N} Desecrated?  How did they do that?
Ah, evil thieves slipped into His great house and performed a terrible deed!  With the devil's hands they stole a most holy of holy symbols!  What has our society come to when the wretched pawns of Satan feel free to run rampant in Bob's house?!  Can I hear an amen?
Amen, preacher!!
Thank you, Norman!
{N} What did this holy symbol look like?  Maybe I'll come across it.
They stole no less than the sacred cross of the church, my son!  A golden testament to His good word!!
{N} Your parishioners seem a little, um . . . wooden.
The lost sheep doesn't recognize the flock, brother Norman!
Open his eyes, Father!
Amen to that!  My flock is special in the eyes of the Lord, my son!  Right now they sit motionless in deep prayer - so strong is their devotion that they appear to be made of wood, to the common man.  But in truth, they are as alive as you and I!
{N} Um, okay, if you say so.
{N} May I borrow your broom, Preacher Bob?
What?!  By all that's holy . . . that's not a broom, you poor, misguided child!  It is a holy staff!  Brother Norman!  Are his ears clean enough to hear the name of the staff!
Clean as an angel's wings, preacher!
Amen, Norman!  This is the Staff of the Righteous!  Do not touch it!  Your weak flesh cannot accept the purity which flows through the Lord's handiwork!  Only I or one who has achieved Sainthood could handle its divine power!!
{N} I'm probably going to regret asking this, but what exactly would be involved in achieving Sainthood?
Do my ears deceive me?  Can it be, Norman, that this lost soul is seeking for the path of truth?
Praise the Lord!
Amen, brother!  There are many good deeds one can do to achieve Sainthood.  Such as . . . you could turn water into wine, come back from the dead, learn to fly, part the Red Sea . . .
{E} Wait a minute!  Those aren't good deeds, they're miracles!
Amen, brother!  Amen!!
{N} I've found your lost symbol, preacher.
What's that?!  Praise the lord indeed!!
Praise the Lord!
Come forward, my son!
For your performance of a miracle in our accursed times, I dub thee Saint Max of the House of Bob!  Here is thy Staff of Righteousness!  Lean on it whilst you walk on the path of the Lord!
Hallelujah!
{N} Thanks . . . I'll, um . . .   I'll use it for the good of mankind.
Hallelujah!  Amen!
{N} Excuse me, what's your name?
I am Saint Norman, Disciple of Bob.
{N} Disciple of Bob?!  What faith is that?
It is the truth!  Bob's word is truth!  He is the eyes and ears of God!  Oh glorious and most holy of Bobs!  Bob is the most Bob of all!  Hallelujah!  Praise be to Bob!
{N} The preacher seems to be interested in the sin of stealing.  Did something happen?
Ohh, a most foul and wicked occurrence has befallen our most majestic and glorious house of worship!  A sinful calamity of wretched thievery and deception has spirited away the holiest of holy tokens from the house of Bob!!
{N} Oookay, thanks for clearing that up for me.
{N} The preacher seems to be pretty riled up.  Is he always like this?
No.  But one of the evil sinners took something very valuable from the House of Bob!  Therefore we are watchful of all who would approach!  Stay back!
{N} But all I want to do is talk to the preacher!
Then do it from here!
{H} Brother Norman!  Look!  I think I found the holy symbol!
What?!  Oh praise be to Bob!  Preacher!  Preacher!  The symbol has been returned to the House of Bob!
{N} Excuse me, what's your name?
Are you serious, man?  I'm the King!
{N} King of what?
King of rock n' roll, man!  I'm Elvis!
{N} The Elvis?!  But I thought you were . . . well, you know . . . dead.
Aw, that was all a hoax, man!  The pressure was getting to me.  I needed a break!
{N} Break from what?  All your fame?
Fame, drugs, food, you name it.  I needed time to relax, sober up, slim down.  Know what I mean?
{N} Yes, well, it looks like you've shed a few pounds since that Hawaiian concert.
Thank you!  Thank you very much!
{N} Where is that awful music coming from?
I wish I knew, man!  That stuff is for the birds!
{N} Do you know anything about the other patients?
They ain't patients!  These are my fans, man!  Lemme tell ya, these are the best fans in the world!
{N} What do you think about the record that's playing now?
Well allllright!  This makes me wanna shake my hips like I did on the Sullivan show!
I tell you what, man, this music makes me sicker than a hound dog!
I tell you what, man, that there music sounds like the noise that alley cat made when my mamma ran it over with her pink Caddy.
{N} Excuse me, what's your name?
Skippy!
{N} Where is that awful music coming from?
I don't know, Q-tip!
{N} Q-tip?
Yeah!  Your big cotton head looks like it belongs in a big ear!  Woo hee hee hee hee!
{N} Do you know anything about the other patients?
Do you know anything about the other patients?
{N} Very funny, old man.
Very funny old man!  Hee hee hee!
{N} What do you think about the record that's playing now?
Knock knock!
{N} Who's there?
Boo!
{N} Boo who?
Aw, don't cry!  The music's not so bad!  Tee hee!
I love it.  It makes me very happy.  It reminds me of my late wife, Evelyn.
{N} Oh, I'm sorry.  Do you miss her?
Miss her?  Ha!  That old battleaxe?  Hee hee!  I'm delirious with joy that she kicked the bucket before me!
It's making me sea sick!!
{N} Excuse me, what's your name?
Sir, yes sir!   Eh?  Who the hell are you?  Lemme alone!  Can't an old man get any rest around this ship?
{N} Where is that awful music coming from?
Huh?  Quit talking to me!  I need to sleep off my hangover from shore leave!
{N} Do you know anything about the other patients?
What?  Arrr!  Get off me ship, ye blasted land lubber!
{N} 'Land lubber'?  Come on, no one talks like that for real.
I do, ye scurvy dog!
{N} What do you think about the record that's playing now?
How the hell should -  How the hell should I know?!  I was sleepin' 'til you came over and woke me, you big lunkhead!
Arrgh!  It makes me dream of life under the sea!
Har!  Now there be a melody any good sailor would dance a jig to!
{N} Excuse me, what's your name?
My name is Vera, I think it sounds nice, I ate my husband with carrots and rice!
{N} Where is that awful music coming from?
I like this music, it's got a great beat, it makes me want to stay on my feet!
{N} Do you know anything about the other patients?
They'd be yummy in my tummy!
{N} What do you mean by that?
Chop 'em all up, put 'em in a pot, add some potatoes and see what you've got!
{N} Umm, okay.  Talk to you later.  Bye.
{N} What do you think about the record that's playing now?
I don't like it, but that's okay, I'll dance again some other day!
The music keeps bouncing, around in my head, it makes me wish that I were dead!
It sounds like the ocean, and makes me feel sad, cause I'm stuck here forever for being so bad!
{N} Hello?  You must be Doctor Morgan . . .
Hm?  Oh!  We thought we'd lost you in the fire, Max.  Where have you been?
{N} I . . . I was somewhere else for a while . . .
Well, it's good that you're safe, Max.  But you seem to get into trouble whenever you 'go away'.  I've told you before that you need to stay in control if you expect to get well.
{E} I didn't just go 'away' in my mind, Dr. Morgan!  I was in an actual place!  A small town . . . with children . . . they were real!!  They -
Now, Max, don't get all excited.  I can have one of the orderlies restrain you if necessary.  Will it be necessary, Max?
{N} No.  I'm fine.
{N} I want to get well, doctor.  But I have so many strange thoughts . . . unanswered questions . . .
Curiosity is a good thing, Max.  I wish I had some answers for you.  Perhaps we can talk later, after my work here is done.
{N} What fire?  What happened?
The generator exploded.   Too bad about all of those others up there in the tower.  We could only save so many.
{S} Others?!  What do you mean?!
Don't you understand, Max?  The fire, it wiped out all of the cells in the tower, everyone inside . . .  You're lucky to be alive.
{E} No one seems to be bothered by this . . .  Does anyone know what happened to make the generator explode?!
We haven't discovered the cause yet, but of course we're concerned about all the patients.  Right now we're trying to keep everyone calm and pleasant.  Don't want them to dwell on disturbing things, do we?  No, surely not.
{N} What are you writing, doctor?
I'm conducting an experiment.  The effects of different types of music on all the patients.
Well, bless my soul!  How on earth did you get here, little girl?!
{S} I don't know, mister.  All I remember is looking in the water and then this flash of light . . .  The next thing I knew I was here.    I'm kinda scared 'cause I don't remember much.
Now now, no need to be scared, my dear!  Using my world-renowned powers of deduction, I'd say that you were in a boat and fell overboard.  The tides swept you up and plopped you down here, safe and sound.  Why, I'm sure your family is looking for you as we speak!
{N} My name's Sarah.  What's yours?
What?!  Why, I'm Antonio Baldini!!  Genius, showman, and ringmaster extraordinaire!
{N} Where am I?
You don't know?  Then you're in for quite a treat, little girl!  Because directly behind me is the most fantastical spectacle this world has to offer!!
{S} Huh?
Can it be you've never heard of the world famous Baldini Brothers Amazing Traveling Circus?!  Say it's not so!!  Why, only a few dollars will open the doors of magic, wonder, and grotesquerie!!
{N} Oh, but I have no money.
Hmm, tell you what, my dear.  Since times are tough and the crowd is, um, a little thin this time of year, I'll give you a free pass to the Squid Squash game!!  If you're lucky, you might win some tickets!
{H} Ohh!!  Thank you, Mister Baldini!
Think nothing of it, my dear!  And now, if you'll excuse me, little lady, I have a circus to run!!
Hey, you maggots!  We have a customer!  The show must go on!
{H} Hello, Mr. Baldini!
Why, hello, Sarah!  Are you enjoying the fabulous circus?
{N} I guess so . . . but it's kinda spooky.
That it is, my dear!  But is there no fun in fright?  No beauty in terror?  Look more closely, my dear, and see the sublime wonder of every attraction!!
{N} Well, umm . . . no.
Wha-?!  Surely you have not seen all of our miraculous exhibits!!  Take more time to peruse over each once again!!
{N} This is a weird place for a circus.  Why are you on an island?
The dag-blasted Great Flood of '33 did this to us!
{N} That was a big flood, huh?
Big?  Such a puny word doesn't do justice to the massive wave that doused the entire town!  Why, if we hadn't been camped out on this hillside we would have met the same fate as everyone else!!  Now we're alive, but stuck on this god-forsaken island.
{N} Where did the wave come from?
Prospect Dam!  It collapsed just two days before we were supposed to leave this one-horse town!  The water came so suddenly, very few people had a chance to escape the flood's wrath.  Curse my bad luck!!
{N} Isn't there any way off this island?
Not with Iggy skulking in the water!
{N} Who's Iggy?
Who?  Iggy is a what, my sweet innocent child!  He was my main attraction in the Freak Show.  Now Iggy lives in the waters around this accursed island, and he's big as a house since he's been eating everything in sight.  The only thing that Iggy fears is fire, and fire isn't easy to come by in a flood.  I'm afraid we're all doomed to stay here forever.
{N} Who lives in that big spooky house on the other island?
No one, little lady.  That's why so many of my performers tried to get over there.  The big stars of the show felt that they were better than the freaks and clowns, and wanted their own private island.  They built a boat and everything.
{N} A boat?!  Where is it?
It was destroyed when Iggy ate them all.
{N} If all the big stars tried to get off the island, then why are the strongman and fire-breather still here?
Oh theirs is a complicated story, and it's not really my place to talk about it.  Who can explain the fools and attractions in that great circus called Love?
{N} My name's Sarah.  What's yours?
Well I'll be!  Antonio wasn't crazy after all!  There really is a customer!  My name is Carl Rice, but you can call me Ishmael!   I operate this Squid Squash game.
{N} Squid Squash?  How do you play?
It's quite simple, little girl.  It's a test of might!  After you give me your tickets to play, I'll give you the anchor.  You heave it up, and then squash the squid head here as hard as you can!  That will send a blob of ink up his tentacle.  The higher it goes, the more tickets you win!
{N} Why do I need more tickets?
You need them to go on the rides, of course!
{N} What book are you reading?  Is it a comic book?
What?!  This is a classic, young lady, not some piece of trash!  It's the epic saga of a man obsessed with killing a great white whale!
{S} Oh!! That poor whale!!
No no no, you're missing the point.  The whale is the manifestation of all earthly evils, and the man's pursuit is . . .  Oh, forget it.
{N} I never saw a circus on an island before.
Neither have I, but isn't this the best?  I hated all that travel and landlocked towns!  I always dreamed of a life by the sea, but I never thought it would come true!  Now I eat as much fish as I can catch!
{N} May I play, please?
Sure . . . if you have 3 tickets!
{N} I have a Squid Squash pass that Mr. Baldini gave me!
That's good enough.  Here you go!
{N} I have enough tickets!
Splendid!  Here you go!
{N} Ohh, I don't think I have enough tickets!
Tsk tsk!  Come back when you can scrape together a few!
{N} Who lives in that big spooky house on the other island?
No one, that I know of.  Although some of us believe that it's haunted!
{E} Really?!
Yeah.  I personally saw a ghost child in the attic window when I used the binoculars!
{N} My name's Sarah.  What's yours?
Oh, ain't you just precious!  As if it ain't bad enough bein' stuck on dis freakin' island, now I gotta wet nurse some little brat!
{E} You're mean!
Yeah?  So what!  When youse come inta Wilbur Smith's wagon, you play by my rules, kid!
{H} Ooo!  Can I have a tattoo?
What?  Hah!  Come back in about ten years, kid.  Tattoos is only for my adult customers.
{N} Where are all your customers, mister?
Youse ain't the brightest bulb on the string, is ya?  Dere ain't no customers!  We're stranded on dis crappy island!  Da only new human bein to land on dis rock since da flood is you, and you're too freakin' young for me to ink!
{N} That was a big flood, huh?
No, it was a little tiny flood.   Now quit asking me stupid questions!!
{N} I never saw a circus on an island before.
Dat's 'cause dere ain't supposed to be any damn circuses on any damn islands!!  How da hell is anyone supposed to go to a circus if dey can't reach it?
{N} Do you drink this stuff?
What?!  Hah!  Of course not!  I use dat stuff for cleanin' da customer's skin afore I tattoo 'em.
{H} May I have a bottle of rubbing alcohol?  Inferno is going to teach me how to breathe fire!
She is, is she?  Ain't ya a little young ta do dat?
{N} No!  I'm almost eight and a half!
Ah, hell, why not?  I sure as hell ain't usin' it.  I got a butt-load of dis crap just sittin' around goin' ta waste.  Knock yourself out, kid.
{N} Ooo!  Those look sharp!
Don't touch!  Dey ain't for little brats like you ta play with!
{N} Who lives in that big spooky house on the other island?
How da hell should I know?  I'm stuck on dis crummy island wit everybody else!  Why dontcha swim over dere and find out?!
Cantcha see I'm busy?  Scram, ya nosy brat!
Hey!!  What da hell do you tink you're doin', ya liddle thief?!  Hands off!!
{N} My name's Sarah.  What's yours?
Meano Geno!  Strongest man alive!
{H} Wow!!  You sure got lots of muscles!!
Duhhh . . . I used to have a lot more . . . but I've kinda let myself go since da flood.
{N} That was a big flood, huh?
Yeah.  We're stuck here until the water goes down.  I lost halfa my weights in dat flood!  I'm gonna be a puny weaklin' like those rotten clowns by the time we get rescued.
{N} I never saw a circus on an island before.
Yeah . . . and dis'll probably be your last.
{N} Who lives in that big spooky house on the other island?
I dunno.  I'm just glad dat Inferno didn't try to go over dere.
{N} Why not?
Her snooty husband, Geraldo, the sword swallower, was gonna go over first . . . but Iggy took good care of him!  Heh heh!
{N} I know you're the one writing love poems to Inferno!  Why don't you just tell her?  If you love her, you should let her know!
Huh?  What?!  I . . . uh . . . No!  Um, oh crap!  How did you figure it out?!  I mean, I'm afraid to tell her!
{N} Afraid?  A big guy like you?
Duh, yeah!  I could bend a steel bar around my neck, but I'm scared of tellin' her how I feel!
{N} But why?
She won't take me seriously!  She thinks I'm just a big dummy!  I don't know how to really prove my love!!
{H} How about a big tattoo of her name on your arm?
Hey!  Dat's not such a bad idea!  If dat don't prove how serious I am, den I dunno what is!
{H} Ooo!  You're getting a real tattoo!  Cool!!  What is it?
It's a big heart with Inferno's name on it.  I hope this gets her attention!
{H} Wow, you must really love her!
Duhh . . . yeah!  I do.  She was always too good for dat skinny sword swallower.  She needs someone who can protect her from Iggy!
{N} Why does she need to be protected?  Iggy stays in the water, right?
Well, I ain't takin' no chances!  He's getting' pretty big out there.  It's just a matter of time, now . . .
{H} Wow!! Do you really breathe fire?!
I do breathe fire, that's right!  What's your name, little girl?
{N} My name's Sarah.  What's yours?
Well, my real name's Jennifer Lang.  But you can call me by my stage name - Inferno.
{N} I never saw a circus on an island before.
If you call this dump a circus.
{H} That's a pretty costume!
Why thank you!  You're just the sweetest little girl!   You're like the daughter I always wanted.
{N} Why don't you have one?
My husband and I never had the chance to start a family.
{N} What happened?
He and the other performers were trying to reach the other island when they were attacked by that squid freak.  I didn't go because I get seasick easily.  He said he'd go check it out, and if it was safe, he'd come back for me.   He never came back.
{N} I'm sorry.
That's all right, dear . . . you didn't know.  I just wish I had someone to pass down my secret of fire breathing to.
{H} Ooo!  Me!  Me!  Please teach me!!
Hmmm, I don't know . . . you're awfully young.
{H} Pleeeeease!!
Welllll . . . okay!  But before we get started, you'll need some fuel.  I'm running low on my own stuff.
{H} I got a bottle of rubbing alcohol!  Will this work?
Sure!  Now, let's see . . . what else do you need?  First off, I'll give you one of my old fire batons.  Second, you can light it here in my fire barrel.  That should be it!  Are you ready?  Watch me carefully and then you try it!
{H} Okay!!
Okay, now you try it!
You did it!  You're a natural!!
{N} Who lives in that big spooky house on the other island?
No one, I think.  That's why my Geraldo was trying to go over to it.  He thought we could live there.
{N} Who's Geraldo?
He was my husband.
{H} I know who's been sending you love poems!
What?!  How did you find out I was getting them?  I haven't told a soul!
{H} I can't tell you how I found out.  But I know that Geno the Strongman is sending them!
Oh no!  That big oaf!  Ahhgh!  My goodness!  He was dating half the girls from the high wire act before the flood!  How can I take that man seriously?
{N} What's an oaf?
Geno is!   My goodness!  He was dating half the girls from the high wire act before the flood!  How can I take that man seriously?
{N} What if he tattoos your name on his arm?
Oh, I don't know.  If he were willing to do that, maybe it would be a start . . .  Just between you and me, I've been awfully lonely since my husband went away.
{H} Inferno!  Guess what!  Geno is getting a Tattoo for you!
Really?  Maybe I misjudged him.  He must have meant what he said in those sweet, simple poems!
{N} My name's Sarah.  What's yours?
Lefty . . . for obvious reasons!
{H} You're very good!
I am, aren't I?  Hee hee!  I can juggle anything!!
{N} Really?
Yeah, but I'm getting bored.  No one challenges me anymore.
Aa-haa!  Hey!  Finally, a challenge!! Thanks, little girl!  Here's a present for you!  Whoop!
{H} Thanks!
You're welcome!
{N} My name's Sarah.  What's yours?
Flipper!
{N} Do you like it here at the circus?
Oh yeah, this is my dream.  All I got as a prop is this friggin' fish!
{N} Why don't you use something else?
What else is there?  I used to get stuff from the crowd, but there is no stinkin' crowd!  This circus sucks!!
{N} My name's Sarah.  What's yours?
What's it to ya, ya little snot?
{S} You don't hafta be so mean!  I was just askin'!
I was just askin'!  Hm!  My name is Trixie, try to remember it!
{N} Do you like it here at the circus?
Are you for real?  This blows!  The only enjoyment I get these days is creamin' my stupid brother!
{N} I don't think that's very nice!
Shuddup!  I don't remember askin' ya about what ya thought, ya shrimp!
{N} Boy, you aren't a very friendly clown!  I thought clowns were supposed to be happy and nice!
Issat so?  Well, most clowns aren't stuck in a run-down circus . . . on an island . . . waiting to get eaten by some giant freak!
{N} What do you mean 'waiting to get eaten'?  What freak?
That God damned squid!  I knew he was bad news the day Antonio bought 'im.  Christ, he ate my dog the first day he was here!   Poor Mr. Poopers!!
{N} I'm sorry.
Sorry?  Oh, that's great, kid, but it won't bring back my dog.  You get away from me before I nail you with a pie!
{N} My name's Sarah.  What's yours?
Simon.
{N} Do you like it here at the circus?
No.  My sister is a real pain in the ass.
{N} Why is she so mean to you?
Aw, I don't know.  She was always kinda mean, but when her dog died . . . man, that pushed her over the edge!
{N} My name's Sarah.  What's yours?
Like I.
{N} Like I?
Yeah . . . Like I give a rat's ass your name's Sarah!  Ha har!
{N} Do you like it here at the circus?
Yeah, dis is a real paradise.  Maybe when I get done talkin' to your dumb ass, I'll  grab a martini by the pool!
{N} You sure do cuss a lot!
So?  What are you gonna do?  Tell my mommy?  Oh dearie me, whatever shall I do?
{H} That balloon looks silly on your head!
Oh does it?  Thank goodness you were here to tell me that.  Whatever would I have done without your keen powers of observation?
{E} You're mean!  Shut up!
Aw, get bent, you little runt!
{N} My name's Sarah.  What's yours?
I'm Zippy . . . Master of the art of fortune telling!  My cards contain the hidden secrets of the cosmos!
{N} Can you tell me my fortune?
Certainly.  Hmm . . . let me consult the cards.  Ah yes!!  This is very interesting indeed!
{H} Ooo!  What do they say!
The sign of the scarab!  This Egyptian symbol indicates a plague of horrifying insects, bent on devouring the planet!
{S} Oh no!  Really?  That sounds scary!
Well . . . it's either that or an eight of clubs, I'm not sure.
A bleeding heart!  You will soon witness a frightening ritual of gore and dismemberment!  A savage people will rain blood down upon you!!
{S} That's awful!  Are you sure you're reading the cards right?
Um, no.  This is just the ace of hearts . . . I think I grabbed the wrong deck of cards this morning.
Royalty!  You are destined to acquire great wealth and power, and will rule over all --  Oh wait a minute.  I think this might just be the queen of diamonds.
The leering face of death!  Oh no, my dear!  The fates have conspired against you and are planning your demise as we speak!
{S} What?!  That's terrible!!  What will I do?!
I'm sorry, my sweet child, but there is no escape.  The cards never lie, they . . . hmm.  Hold on a second.  Upon closer inspection this appears to be the joker of the deck.  I used it for a coaster last night and it sorta blurred the face.  Sorry about that.
{E} Hey!  I talked with the real fortune teller!  She says you're nothing but a big faker!  You can't read fortunes at all!
Humph!  That old bag's just jealous!
{N} My name's Sarah.  What's yours?
Well I'll be!  Hee hee hee!  A leprechaun!  Where's yer pot of gold, little leprechaun? Heh heh heh.
{E} I'm not a leprechaun!  I'm a girl!
Ah, you don't fool me, leprechaun!  Hee hee hee!  My name is Laughin' Larry.  Heh Heh Heh.  Show me to your pot of gold!
{N} Do you like it here at the circus?
Oh sure.  Nothing beats waitin' to die of starvation or bein' eaten alive by some freak, ha ha ha ha!  Oh, let the good times roll!  Hic!
{N} Don't you guys have enough food?
Uh, maybe enough for a month or so, but once that giant squid eats all the fish around here, we're screwed!  Heh heh heh!  Aah, heh heh . . . You can help us, can't you, little leprechaun?  You can . . .  ah heh heh heh!  Screwed!!
{S} Eaten alive, you mean?!
That squid's gonna eat us all, I tell ya!  We're all doomed!  Heh he he,  ha ha ha HAAA!!  It's enough to drive a clown to drink!  Hic!  Belch!
{N} My name's Sarah.  What's yours?
Oliver Tweed, and I may say that I have never seen so little a Sarah in my life!  You're small, kid.  S.  M.  Alllll!!  Har de har har!!
{N} Who's that clown on the roof?
That's Spanky the clown!  He sits on the roof so he can see far and wide!
{N} Why?
He's looking for the little bastard that stole his nose from the sign over there!  Some little brat . . . who looked just like you . . . stole it in the last town we were in!!
{N} How many tickets to get in?
Five tickets, shrimp!  But you better go see if Spanky thinks yer big enough to handle all the terror inside!
It don't matter to you, runt!  Spanky's arm was way over yer head, so am-scray!  Come back innabout three years!  Haw haw haw!
Five tickets, kiddo!  I don't know how you did it, but you grew up real quick.  Dat's da damndest thing I ever saw!!
Thanks, squirt!  The house of horror awaits!
I said five tickets!  What's wrong with ya?  Is ya deaf and puny?!  Get the hell outta here!  And don't come back 'til ya have enough tickets!!
{N} My name's Sarah.  What's yours?
Stuart Limpkin, my good child.  A purveyor of earthly oddities, if you will.  A peddler of the perverted beasts that lurk in the shadows of your mind!  I am a collector of freaks, and I humbly welcome you to my monument of monstrosities!
{N} Where do the freaks come from?
Does it really matter, child?  They have been assembled here for your entertainment, kept safely behind iron bars so you can observe at your leisure.
{N} How many tickets to get in?
A mere five tickets.  Half of ten, and one less than half a dozen!  A small price to pay to see what few will encounter in the space of a lifetime!
Thank you!  Now step lively, little girl, for the gallery of the grotesque awaits!!
Perhaps I did not make myself clear when I told you the price of admission!  Let me re-iterate!  Five!  Not six, not four, and certainly not three!  Five thin tickets is required in order to gain access to my showroom of social outcasts!
{N} I've heard that one of your freaks got loose during the flood, and now he's eating everyone who goes in the water!
The forces of mother nature are not mine to wield, my girl!  During the great calamity, Iggy took the opportunity to free himself from the shackles of man and return once more to his watery domain.  Who am I to judge this misunderstood creature?
{H} I picked the lock on Timber's cage!
I see that!  I hope he comes back because now I only have two freaks!  What kind of show is that?  My reputation is ruined!
{S} Mr. Limpkin!  I think Timber was killed!!
What?!  What happened?!
{S} He dug a hole and fell down into some underground lake!  Then something grabbed him and he disappeared!!
This is terrible!  That squid freak is going to kill us all!  I wish I never bought him!!
{N} Hello.  My name is -
Sarah.
{S} Wow!  You knew!
Of course I did.  I'm quite skilled in the mystic arts, my child.  My name is Lady Ivanna.
{N} Would you tell me my future?
Normally I would charge you . . . but with the way things are, I see no point in it.  Come closer, I will need to see your palm.
I see that you are far from home, and that you are not who you appear to be.  You possess the solution to an important problem, although outside forces conspire against you . . .  How unusual!  Your hands tell the stories of someone easily three times your age . . . Well, I must rest now, but I will give you one final piece of advice.
On your way home, beware of the pit of darkness.  You can only pass through safely when you have sought out the wand, flask, and reflection!
I don't see why you think that your future has changed, but I will humor you with one more reading.  Let's see . . . hmmm.  I didn't see this before!  This wavy line is very interesting, it curves back on itself . . .  Some time in the near future, you'll have a powerful machine.  You will play games on this machine . . . a game called 'Sanitarium'.  How odd.  Now I am completely drained, and I must send you away once more!    Hocus Pocus!!
Back again?  Didn't you ever hear of going to the well one too many times, you greedy child?  I think you need to be taught a lesson!!
{N} I met another fortune teller, his name is -
Zippy!  That pinhead!  He's a fake!  Just a stupid clown with delusions of grandeur!!
{N} I'd like to try.
One ticket, if you please!
{N} I have enough tickets!
All right, little miss!  Give it a try!
We have a winner!
Sorry, darlin'!  You win some, you lose some!
{N} Ohh, I don't think I have enough tickets!
Beat it, small fry!  This ain't no charity booth!
{N} I'll take a shot!
One ticket, little missy!
{N} I have enough tickets!
Keep your eyes on the pigs and your finger on the trigger!
Nice shootin', eagle eye!
Har har har!  Looks like ya need ta get your eyes checked!
{N} Ohh, I don't think I have enough tickets!
Hit the road, cheapskate!!
{N} I'll knock 'em down!
One ticket per throw!
{N} I have enough tickets!
Give it your best shot, little girl!  Try not to hurt yourself!! Har har!!
Holy crap!  What an arm!  You busted up my pins!!
What a wimpy toss!  Take a powder, little girl, and let the men through!
{N} Ohh, I don't think I have enough tickets!
Hmph!  Act like the trees and leave, shrimpo!
{N} Here's your pin back, mister.
What the hell am I supposed to do with that?  You busted up my two other pins, you little muscle bound freak!  Cripes!  And I thought it was boring around here before!  Now what am I gonna do?!
{N} Gee whiz, I'm sorry.
Yeah, yeah . . . lemme alone.
{N} Can I play again?
Is your memory as short as you are?  You broke my game, remember?!  Beat it!!
{N} My name's Sarah.  What's yours?
I am Pret-zool, the master of elasticity!
{H} Ooo!  Can you light up a light bulb?!
What?  No no!  Not electricity . . . elasticity!!
{N} What does that word mean, mister?
That means I can twist and stretch myself into many different shapes.
{N} How long have you been a freak in the circus?
For many years now.  I've seen quite a few freaks come and go, but that squid boy was the worst of the lot.
{N} What made him the worst?
He was violent from day one.  They had him in a tank next to mine at first, but I made them move us apart . . . after he tried to choke me to death with one of his tentacles.
{N} Oh no!  How did you escape?
Well, he was young then, and only a fraction of the size he is now.  I stretched my arms thin enough to squeeze between the tentacle and my neck, and broke his grasp.
{N} How did that cage break?
During the flood, Iggy's wagon tipped over and his tank ruptured.  With all that water, and room to move, he was able to wriggle out of his chains.  Once free of them, it was quite easy for him to bend back the bars and swim away.
{N} Where did he swim to?
He swims around the island, preying on anyone or anything that dares to venture into the water.  It's no secret that Iggy hated it here at the Freak Show, hated the whole circus.  He wants revenge.  Iggy is afraid of fire, but as long as he stays out in the water, he's untouchable.  We are doomed.
{N} Why do you say that?
It's simple, my child.  Even if Iggy cannot reach us all on land, he's been eating so many of the fish that they now steer clear of the island.  We'll run out of all food and supplies within a month.  Thus there is little to do besides meditate on the order of things, and await the end.
{N} My name's Sarah.  What's yours?
Grrrr . . . Timberrr!  Go away, kid, before I eat you!!
{E} What a terrible thing to say!  I was just being friendly!
If you want to be friendly . . . rrrrrrelease me from this damn cage!
{N} If I let you out, you'll eat me!  You said so yourself!
Grrrromise . . . I promise not to . . . if you let me out!
{N} How can I trust you?  You look like you'd eat the first thing that you get your hands on!
Rrrrr . . . no!  Not you!  I want . . . I smell bones!  Sweet scent of marrow . . . is driving me mad!  I'm starving!  I want out!  Will  you lead me to the booo-wwwooooooooonnes?
{N} You can smell bones?  Where are they?  I haven't seen any on this entire island!
Burrried!  Deep . . . rrrunderground!  I can smell them, I can!  I'll dig 'em up!
{N} Gee . . . I don't know . . .
Please, kid, I'm dying in this wrrretched cage!!  I need out!!
{N} Why doesn't Stuart just open your cage?  Doesn't he have a key?
Key lost.  Grrr.  Damned Stuart lost it!  Need to pick it open now.
{N} How long have you been with the circus?
Rrrrrrr . . . since a pup.  I've grrrown up here.
{N} So this is your home?
Rrr.  Home.  Yes.
{N} How did that cage break?
Slimy squid boy brrroke loose!  Wish I could!
What arrre you doing?!  That won't fit!!  Need something smallerrr!
That's it!!  Awoooooo!  Free!  Free!  Thank yooouuuu!!  Bones!  Dig 'em up!
{N} My name's Sarah.  What's yours?
My name's Matt, and my sister's name is Ashley.
{S} You're connected!!
That's what Siamese twins are, Sarah.
{N} How long have you been with the circus?
As long as . . . We can remember.
{N} How sad!  Don't you miss your parents?
We can't remember our parents.  The closest thing we have to a parent is . . . Stuart.
{N} How did that cage break?
That disgusting squid boy did that.  It doesn't surprise us.  He's a violent creature.  We're sure his upbringing had a lot to do with it.
{N} What do you mean by that?
Stuart bought him from a preacher in a strange little town.  It seems this child was the result of an affair between the preacher and a local farmer's wife.  They kept her pregnancy secret for almost five months . . . Then an early childbirth . . . And he came out.
{N} He?
A normal baby would have died from such a birth.  But this one was . . . He was abnormally strong, with severely deformed limbs that lacked any bone structure.  The woman was so distraught, she took her own life.  And the preacher kept the child in a wet, dark cellar for months . . . Letting him live off of rats and scraps of food . . . Until the circus came, and the Freak Show.
{N} Why didn't he just give the child to Stuart?
He said he needed the money . . . To fix his church.  Apparently a storm knocked something off of it.  But that story was probably just an excuse . . . So he could get rid of Iggy.
{N} My name's Sarah.  What's yours?
Wow!!  Another kid!  That's swell, even if you are just a girl!  My name's Sean.
{N} Are we the only kids here?
Yeah.  It sucks!  I get real lonely all by myself . . . I don't have anyone to play with.
{N} If you're so lonely, why don't you go to the circus?  There's lots to do there!
Mamma says I can't.  She says the circus is fulla evil folks, and they brought the flood down on us with their sinning ways.
{N} That's silly!  How could they have?
I dunno . . . Mamma knows best.
{N} Do you always obey your mamma?
Most of the time.
{N} What do you mean most of the time?
Well, I snuck out and went over to the big top one night, even though Mamma said not to.  It was pretty boring.  Most everybody was sleeping, 'cept the strongman.  He was writin' some sappy love poems or somethin'.  They were pretty bad.  I remember one went like this:  'Oh Inferno, you make my heart burn-oh!'  Ha ha!!
{N} Do you like living in a circus?  It must be fun!
Not really . . . the clowns are mean!
{N} Is this section of the island your home now?
Yeah . . . if you can call this a home.  It's just a bunch of cruddy shacks.
{N} Where's all the other families?
Me and my folks are all that's left!  There used to be a lot more, but they kept disappearin'.
{N} What's happening?
No one knows for sure, but we think it's that monster!
{S} Monster?!
Yeah, the squid thing!  My dad says it's just a matter of time before it gets us all!   I don't wanna be eaten!!
{N} You live right near the freak beach.
Yeah.  They're not so bad . . . but my folks hate 'em.  My mamma says they're God's mistakes, and ought to be killed.
{E} That's a terrible thing to say!
Well, that squid thing is tryin' to kill us all, isn't it?  If it woulda been killed when it was a baby, we wouldn't be in danger!
{N} My name's Sarah.  What's yours?
Where'd you come from, you little imp?  I haven't seen you around here before.
{N} I just arrived here . . . I don't quite remember how, though.
That's a convenient story, isn't it?  Bah!!  Heaven help us, the sinners are breeding more of their kind!  You're as evil as the rest of those God forsaken freaks!
{E} I'm not a freak!  I'm just a little girl!
Hmph!  You don't fool me, you little devil!  I know the ways of Beelzebub!  You can alter your appearance at will!  Why, you're probably in league with the watery abomination that's killing us off one by one!!
{N} Uh - bomb - ina, what?
Oh, stop pretending as if you don't know, you wicked little specter!  I'll not fall into your web of lies!  Your kind brought about the damnation of our town with your vulgar display of profanity!!
{N} What happened to the town?
As if you don't know, hellspawn!!
{N} But I -
Begone!
{N} I met your son.  He was -
Stay away from my child or I'll peel you like a potato, you wretched fiend!  I don't care if you drag me down into the eternal pits of hell, but I'll be damned before I let you harm one hair on his head!!
{N} Your husband is a very nice man.
Husband?  You mean this doppelganger?  Bah!  He's not my husband!
{N} Then why are you standing here with him?
Don't smart off with me, you poisonous serpent!  You know as well as I that if I were to turn my back on him he'd eat my brain like a grapefruit!!
{N} My name's Sarah.  What's yours?
My name is Collin O'Leary, and my wife here is Martha.
{N} What happened to the town?
A flood.  The old Prospect Dam, just beyond Grandview point, finally burst after years of neglect.
{N} Where's Grandview Point?
Well, it's where the Big Top is now.  It used to be the highest point in town . . . now it's all that's left.
{N} How did that happen?
Well, it was just sort of forgotten over the years.  We knew that it needed repairs, but we took it for granted, thought it would last one more year.  After all, a town only has so much money to spend, and other things always seemed to be more important at the time.   I guess we were wrong.
{N} What happened to the rest of the townsfolk?
Most of them were killed in the flood.  The few survivors, like me family, came up here to find shelter.
{N} Where are they?  I don't see anyone but your family.
We're all that remain.  That squid thing has been picking us off one by one.
{N} But how can it?  We're high up from the water!
Since it's been in the open water, it's grown to almost triple its original size.  At night sometimes, I've seen its long tentacles probing the ground, searching for us . . .
{E} Can't you do anything?
I'm afraid not.  We're all doomed.
{N} I met your son.  He's nice.
Sean?  Aye, he's a good lad.  Although I wish his mother wouldn't baby him so much.
{N} I don't think your wife likes me that much, Mr. O'Leary.
She doesn't like anybody . . . not even me.  Ever since the flood, she's not been the same woman.  I can't even have a civil conversation with her anymore.   She's convinced that I'm some sort of demon.
Up.  The Queen awaits.
After long ages of waiting, the time has come!  Today you assemble as outsiders, invaders; tomorrow your troops will sweep down upon the city in a murderous wave of retribution!
For too long you have known suffering, you have dwelt beneath the surface and watched your aggressors live in lands where you once lived.  Will you remain underground forever?  Can you endure this terrible injustice for one more day?
Though I am one of them,  I too have been oppressed by your enemy!  They laughed at me, and my work . . .  The very work which has given you your new cybernetic enhancements!    The technology which will mow down all opposition in the coming war!    The work which will allow you to overrun the capital city of Gronterra and assume your rightful place as rulers of this planet . . . your planet!
Your time has come!!  Tomorrow's end will see the end of the cyclopean age, and the dawn of the insectoids!!
By the Makers!  Grimwall . . . you're Grimwall!!  But what are you doing here?  Why have you returned to us?  I thought Gromna had everything under control . . .
{N} Grimwall?  Is that my name?  I don't remember much.  Just waking up in this hive . . . and having to battle a few insectoids.  I had to use this strange device that I found on the large one, just to pass their security forces.
It's an ID harness.  Gromna built them for the insectoids since they lost their sight.  With that on, you look like another bug to them.  That's why they're not swarming all over you.
Look, my name is Gravin.  We need to talk more . . . but until the work slows down, I'm stuck here.  Afterwards I'm going back to my pod --- we can meet there.  My pod's globe code is 'Grenesir.'  Use it if you need to get in there for anything.
Look, I'm too busy to talk now!  The couriers are delivering embers from the furnace at a fantastic rate.  I'll meet you later in my pod when they shut the furnace down . . . if they shut the furnace down.
There you are!  I was beginning to get worried!  I thought something terrible might happen to you at the furnace . . . especially since your memory is gone.
{N} No . . . I don't remember much of anything.  I wouldn't even know my own name, if you hadn't told me.
Every cyclopean child knows the name of Grimwall!  You're the great hero of the War of the One!
{N} War of the One?  Can you tell me about it?
Oh my . . . you are confused, aren't you.    The War of the One was a pivotal point in the history of our people.  For years, we had fought the insectoids, neither side gaining ground as the planet was ravaged by countless battles.
The Makers, creators of All and of Nothing, watched silently for many years before taking action.  They spoke to the leaders of both sides through grand visions, declaring that there was to be one final battle for supremacy.  The victor would rule the planet, and the defeated race would be forced underground, never to return to the surface again.
{N} We won?
Yes.  Thanks to you!  You destroyed nearly a third of the troops all by yourself!
{N} If we won, then why are these things back above ground?
No one really knows.  Actually, no one really believed the story of the War of the One, or thought that there were any insectoids . . . until now.
{N} That evil machine will be silent for a while!
Evil?  It's just a furnace . . . isn't it?
{E} The thing was burning children, Gravin!  Cyclopean children!
What?!  But how can this be?  Gromna would never allow such a thing to happen?
{E} Gromna . . . that's the name the bugs were using at the furnace!  They said he's giving the orders to burn the children's bodies!
That's absurd!!  He's my mentor . . . a brilliant entomologist!  He'd never -
{N} Ento- what?
Entomologist.  He's our foremost specialist on insects.  That's why the Peace Council chose him for this mission.
{E} Mission?!  What mission!?  What the hell is going on here?!
We were sent here to examine this Hive a few months ago.  We were captured, but Gromna convinced the Queen to put aside her plans of conquest and negotiate a peace treaty.  Since then, it's been peaceful for both sides.  In fact, tomorrow is the day that both leaders will meet to sign the treaty.
{N} I tell you it's true, Gravin.  Something is terribly wrong here and I think that this Gromna person is somehow involved.   You must help me!
I'm sorry, but I can't . . .  Not unless you have some physical proof to back up these wild accusations!
{N} Very well.  If proof is what you want, then that's what you'll get!
{N} What are these sickening insect creatures?  They seem familiar to me somehow . . .
These are our ancient rivals from the War of the One.
{N} Gravin, Chik-tok requires authorization to upgrade my ID harness.  Who can do that?
Normally, Gromna is the only one who can authorize such upgrades . . . but with the increased activity in the Queen's chambers, he remains there almost exclusively.  I think we can fool Chik-tok, if I make my position sound important enough.
{N} What should I say?
Tell him that your authorization comes from Gravin, prot
of Gromna, honorable assistant to her Majesty.  That should do it.
{N} I brought you the proof you asked for Gravin.  Are you going to help me?
By the Makers . . .  Yes . . . of course.  I suppose we should search Gromna's pod.  Come on, I have his globe code.
{N} I've seen your fellow team members in the Queen's chambers.  Gromna has interchanged their lower bodies with insectoid anatomy.
What?!  I haven't seen them since . . .  We must save them!!
{N} I'm sorry, Gravin, but their minds are gone.  It's too late.
May the Makers preserve their souls.
{N} What's the globe code, Gravin?
Immortal'.  That's the word to unlock the door.
{N} What are those?
They appear to be schematics of some kind.  Judging by the shape and general mass, I'd say they were diagrams of the Great Machine.
{N} Great Machine?  What's that?
It's the huge round piece of machinery that sits on the edge of the hive.  Some say it was left there by the Makers themselves, others think that it's a power source of some type.  It used to emit a weird humming noise, but now it remains silent . . . hmmm.
{N} What?
According to these notes, two parts may have been removed to aid the insectoids.  I need to visit the Great Machine and see for myself.
{N} Have you figured out the purpose of the machine?
Part of it . . . but I need time to properly study it.  Gromna has removed two pieces from it, generators of some kind.  I need to attach the missing pieces to get the Machine running again.  Unfortunately, only Gromna knows where they are.
{S} Hunnh?!
Oh great!  Now I'm stranded here!
{N} Sorry.  This flimsy stuff wasn't made to support my weight!
Oof!!  Where did you find this?
{N} It was powering some type of machine that drained the blood out of the children and fed the Queen.
This is awful!  How could I have been so wrong about Gromna!!
{N} What is it?!
It appears to be a miniature worm hole!
{N} Where does it lead?
Nowhere, right now.  Think of this as a hallway with only one door open.  Until another door can be opened, this doesn't lead anywhere.
{N} What about the second missing piece?
That could be it.  Wherever it is, you must hurry and find it before the peace treaty tomorrow.  Something tells me that it's nothing more than a clever disguise for a more sinister plot!
Grimwall!  You're back!!  Put that in the open spot over there!!
My God . . . that's it!  All along . . . it's been so simple!
{E} Now what?!  The whole damn Hive will be bearing down on us any second now!!
Hold on!  I've figured it out!  The second piece serves as a compass for the wormhole - with this I can open a doorway anywhere!  I'm setting the coordinates for the chambers of the Peace Council.  When we tell them about Gromna, they'll launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike against the Hive!!   That's it!!

Guh . . . guh . . . Grimwall the huh . . . hero?   Too late to suh . . . to save us nuh . . . now, hero!
{N} Where are you from?
Ruh . . . research team . . . suh . . . suh . . . sent to investigate . . . the insects . . . tuh . . . toids . . .
{N} Sent by whom?
Cuh . . . Council of Peace . . . sent us . . . to suh . . . stop the puh . . . puh . . . plague of . . . insectoids.
{S} Plague?  You mean the insects were going to take over the cities below?
Yuh . . . yes.  Uh . . . uh . . . until Gromna came up . . . with huh . . . his puh . . . his plan.
{N} You mean the Peace Treaty?
Ha ha ha!  Puh . . . puh . . . Peace Treaty?!  Huh . . . Hell no!  He's helping the buh . . . the bugs get stronger with those . . . cybernetics . . .  They're guh . . . going to attack . . . duh . . . during the meeting for the Treaty!!
{S} What?!  I must warn the Council before it's too late!!
Already . . . already too luh . . . late.  Tuh . . . tuh . . . too far away . . . from the city . . .  Our puh . . . poor people are . . . doomed.
{E} Gromna is a traitor!!

{N} Team?  What team is that?
{N} What are you doing here?
I fuh . . . fuh . . . feed the . . . clones.
{N} These aren't real children?
Ruh . . . real enough . . . for the Queen . . . tuh . . . to feed on.
{S} By the Makers!!
The muh . . . muh . . . Makers . . . cannot help . . . cannot help us now.
{N} Who are you?
Grella.  I'm surprised to see another cyclops in the Hive . . . especially in the Queen's chambers.  You seem familiar to me . . . do I know you?
{N} I am Grimwall.
The Grimwall?!  Of the War?  But how can this be?!  It must be a sign from the Makers!
{N} Where are you from?
The city, of course.  I was part of Gromna's research team . . . before he betrayed us.
{N} I don't understand . . . how did Gromna betray your team?
It's a little complicated.  But I've managed to piece it all together.  I can tell you the whole story, if you like.
{N} I don't have much time . . . but I'd like to hear your story.
I'll keep it brief.  After we were captured, the Queen was set to execute us.  But Gromna convinced the Queen to let us live . . . although now I wish we'd been killed swiftly, instead of suffering through Gromna's so-called surgeries.
{N} I don't understand.  How does this surgery fit into the insectoids' plans?
It doesn't.  Gromna has his own agenda.  He seeks to unlock the secret of immortality.  The insectoids have a greater metabolism than us, so he hopes to merge the two species and then use cybernetic enhancements in order to live forever.  We're his experiments, his failures.  We've been assigned to work here until we die.
{E} Why do you stay here?!  Why not just escape?!
We are part insectoid.  We must obey the Queen's will, whether we want to or not.  I suppose it doesn't matter, anyway.  One of the unfortunate side effects of merging our two species is dementia.  Soon I'll be quite mad, just like the rest.
{N} What do you do here?
I tend to the clones, monitoring their life signs.  When they are near the end, I must call for a drone to remove it and carry its body down to the furnace.  Then another drone brings up another clone.   I do what I can to make their short lives a little less painful.  It saddens me to see them suffer so.
{N} How does this thing work?
It's basically a large transfusion machine.  Blood is drawn out of the clones and fed to the Queen.
{N} Is there any way to shut it down?
Not that I know of.  Gromna built it himself with some strange parts.  Only he knows how it truly works.
{N} Who are you?
Chik-tok.  Cybernetic technician.
{N} What is your function?
To integrate cybernetic enhancements to the flesh.
{N} Who designed these robotics?
Gromna, honorable assistant to Her Majesty.
{N} Where is he?
He is within the Queen's chambers.  Since it is the Eve of Retribution, there is much preparation required.  His plan must be executed perfectly.
{N} Eve of Retribution?
Are your memory pathways in need of service?  The Eve of Retribution is known by us all.  As of tomorrow, we will return to our rightful position as the dominating race of the planet.  Under the guise of peace we shall collect a debt that has been unpaid for decades.
{N} What plan do you speak of?
Your memory banks must be fluctuating.  Gromna has seen the error of his kind's ways, and has come to aid us in our desire for revenge.  With his gift of cybernetics, we shall once again rule the surface.
{N} How will this gift aid us?  Are we not mighty enough to conquer the cyclops without them?
Without the speed of cybernetics, we would be vulnerable to the nuclear fire which the enemy controls, incinerated before we even reached the city.  But with the aid of cybernetics, we will be swarming within the walls of the capital before their hands can even reach the launch buttons.  The dawn will bring the Age of the Insectoid.  It is inevitable.
{N} I require my ID harness to be upgraded.
Upon whose authorization will I grant this procedure?
{N} Umm . . .
You delay in your response.  I am busy.  Return when you can produce the proper authorization.
{N} Gravin, prot
of Gromna, honorable assistant to Her Majesty.
Gravin?  Hold while I search my data banks for confirmation.   My records indicate that Gravin is the assistant to Gromna.  However, his authorization alone is not enough.  I will need to verify that you are of sufficient age to be placed within the Royal Guard.   Proceed to limb scanner for positive age identification.
{N} Hmm.  The opening is far too small for my arm.
Age requirements verified.  Upgrade authorized.  Step forward to have ID harness upgraded.   Prepare for upgrade treatment . . .
Not so many . . . slow down!  Too many and the machine will overheat!!
{N} Who are you?
Chik-nik.  Furnace operator.   Why do you ask, guard drone?  Why are you here?
{N} I'm here to . . . inspect the furnace.
It's been suitably repaired.  But if Her Majesty needs confirmation, then go ahead and get on with it.  Just stay out of the way!  We're very busy!
{N} What is your function?
To regulate the flow of air into the furnace.
{N} What is the purpose of this furnace?
Are you testing my knowledge?  Very well . . .  This is the main power supply of the Hive.  It was built by Gromna himself!  It maintains the temperature of the Queen's chambers and also is used to smelt the raw ember into a highly concentrated power source.
{N} Where does the ember come from?
We found deposits of it within the mountain while we were tunneling our way up to the surface.  When Gromna joined our cause, he recognized it as a possible power source for cybernetics, if reduced to its purest form.
{N} How do you regulate the temperature?
It's very complicated.  You'd need to be at least the level of Operator to understand it, and you are still merely a drone guard.
{N} How do I become an Operator?
Hmph!  An ambitious drone!  You are far too young to even be considered for it!  I've served the Queen for generations!  With age comes respect and station!
{N} What about those bellows over there?
The assigned drones pump the bellows, regulating the flow of air into the furnace.  Through that, we control the flames that are used to smelt the ember.
{S} Are those Cyclopean children being thrown in?!
Don't be so alarmed.  According to Gromna, they won't pollute the ember.
{E} Where do they come from?  And why burn them?!
Does this investigation require me to explain everything to you, drone?   It's a convenient way to dispose of their sickening little bodies once the Queen is through with them.  Granted, the ashes and smell can be a bit nauseating, but one gets used to them after a while.
Drones!  Stop the bellows!  Seal the pipe!  To continue pumping with that damage would overheat the furnace.
Scrrreeeeeeech!!  Yeeeeeaaaaaagghhh!!
{N} A memo regarding the tower bridge.  'Due to recent problems with the generator, all employees are asked to keep the tower bridge extended at all times . . .  It will be extremely difficult to extend the bridge from the outer ring should the power go out . . .'
{N} A letter for Doctor Morgan from a Professor Cunningham . . .  Something about an ancient key, found here in the asylum . . .  'The key you describe must be very old indeed . . . I have found documentation that may link it to Aztec culture, though we'd have to examine the object carefully here at the institute in order to confirm this theory.'
{N} Memo from the chief of security.  It gives some details about a patient escape, number 227.  The memo says that the west wing is 'inadequately contained' and all of the patients have been transferred to . . . the tower cells, here.  But where are they now?
{N} Here's an early entry. 'I wish Mommy wasn't so sad all the time. She cries a lot. She says that Daddy drinks too much. Daddy's been staying in the patch until dark.  When Dad comes in he yells at Mommy and they fight real bad. He yells a lot lately.'
{N} Another entry. 'Mommy's up in heaven now. Dad said she had an accident and God took her away. I miss her a lot. I wish she were here to stop Dad from drinking so much. Dad smells bad when he drinks that stuff. He gets real mad and he starts hitting me.'
{N} Skip a few pages here . . .  'Today was a bad day! A big rock fell out of the sky and hit our barn! Dad's real mad about that and all the vines that are growing out of it . He was gonna cut them down, but Father O'Toole wouldn't let him.  Now Dad's even more mad cause we're gonna lose all our pumpkins.'
{N} Last entry.  'Prayed to Mommy again today. I hope she heard me, because I had to be real quiet so Dad wouldn't find me. He was hitting me again and it hurt a lot this time.  I hid out by the rock in the barn. It's warm and makes me feel good. Sometimes I can even hear music coming out of it.'
{N} It's an obituary . . .  'Marilyn Lee Driscoll, age 32, died Saturday . . .  Husband Jeddah . . . daughter Carol . . . and son Lawrence.'
{N} An article about a 'new star in the sky'.  Many people saw the star . . . but an astronomer claims that the star is actually a comet.
{N} Article about the annual town pumpkin fair.  Supposed to be the 'biggest yet'.  Let me know when it starts.
{N} Interesting news.  Seems that a comet altered its path and headed for Earth.  'The Eye of God lights up the night sky'.
{N} This is a piece about the local preacher, a Reverend O'Toole.  The reverend claimed that the comet was the 'Eye of God', a sign of heavenly anger towards the townspeople.
{N} 'Local man questioned in wife's death'.  Says that Marilyn Driscoll was found in her bathtub, both wrists cut.  The police questioned the husband, Jeddah, as a matter of standard procedure.
{N} Hmm.  Looks like a comet actually hit ground in this town, 'causing a landslide to block Route 30 . . . falling bridges . . . power failures . . .'  The rest of the page is burnt away.
{N} Another article.  'Reverend O'Toole sworn in as interim mayor'.  The reverend made it illegal to hamper the growth of the vines, saying that the people should 'accept punishment for their sins of pride and greed'.
{N} 'Due to harsh economic conditions, this will be the final edition of the Observer.'  There's something else here.  'Charges of child abuse filed against Jeddah Driscoll have been dropped . . .'
